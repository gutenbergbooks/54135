<h2>WHIST; OR BUMBLEPUPPY?</h2>


<div class="center">———</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have been rather lengthy in our remarks on this book,
as it is the best attempt we have ever seen to shame very bad
players into trying to improve, and also because it abounds
with most sensible maxims, dressed up in a very amusing and
palatable form.”—<i>The Field.</i></p>

<p>“‘Whist; or Bumblepuppy?’ is one of the most entertaining
and at the same time one of the soundest books on Whist ever
written. Its drollery may blind some readers to the value of
its advice; no man who knows anything about Whist, however,
will fail to read it with interest, and few will fail to
read it with advantage. Upon the ordinary rules of Whist
‘Pembridge’ supplies much sensible and thoroughly amusing
comment. The best player in the world may gain from his
observations, and a mediocre player can scarcely find a better
counsellor. There is scarcely an opinion expressed with
which we do not coincide.”—<i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>“Lectures on the points most essential to the acquisition
of a complete knowledge of the game. The lessons here given
will well repay perusal.”—<i>Bell’s Life.</i></p>

<p>“All true lovers of Whist will give a hearty welcome to this
work. It is a small book, but full of weighty matter. We
have not space to analyse the positive rules laid down by
‘Pembridge’ for the guidance of those who wish to qualify as
Whist players. Suffice it to say that they are all sound, and
most of them worth committing to memory.”—<i>Sportsman.</i></p>

<p>“It would be very easy to write at greater length than we
have done in praise of ‘Pembridge’s’ little book. But we
have said enough to indicate its nature and scope; and we
feel sure that any of our readers who may meet with it will
endorse our verdict that it is a real addition to the literature
of Whist.”—<i>Australasian.</i></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">As</span>, humanly speaking, you will probably play
something for the next fifty years, should you
select either Whist or Bumblepuppy,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it will be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
well for your own comfort—the comfort of others is
a minor consideration<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—to have some idea of their
general principles; but first you must decide which
of these two games you intend to play, for though
they are often confounded together, and are both
supposed to be governed by the same ninety-one laws
and a chapter on etiquette, they differ much more
distinctly than the chalk and cheese of the present
day. Professor Pole in his “Theory of Whist,”
Appendix B, has made a very skilful attempt (by
modifying the maxims of Whist) to make the two
games into a kind of emulsion. I was rather taken
with this, and having been informed that the most
incongruous materials will mix, if you only shake
them together long enough, I have given this plan a
fair trial, and failed.</p>

<p>It may be that I had not sufficient patience and
perseverance, but the principal cause of failure I
found to be this: the Bumblepuppist, like Artemus
Ward’s bear, “can be taught many interesting things
but is unreliable;” he only admires his own eccentricities,
and if a person of respectable antecedents
gets up a little pyrotechnic display of false cards for
his own private delectation, the Bumblepuppist
utterly misses the point of the joke, he fails even to
see that it is clever: if such a comparison may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
drawn without offence, he doesn’t consider that what
is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</p>

<p>In the face of this difficulty, I should recommend
you to treat them as separate games: as you go down
in one scale and up in the other they closely approximate;
that extremes meet is a law of nature, and
between the worst Whist and the best Bumblepuppy
it is almost impossible to draw the line.</p>

<p>Other elementary forms, protozoa for instance,
are often so much alike that it is difficult to decide
whether they are plants or animals; but representative
specimens of each game, beyond being found at
the same table, (in scientific slang, having the same
habitat,) have scarcely one point in common, you
might just as reasonably mistake horse-radish for
beef.</p>

<p>If you elect Whist (I shall refer to the laws later
on) begin by learning the leads, and the ordinary play
of the second, third and fourth hand, which you will
find in any Whist Book;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> this can be done in a few
days; then after cutting for partners (see <a href="#Footnote_2_2">note</a> to <a href="#Law_14">Law
14</a>) as soon as the cards are dealt, <i>not before</i> (see note
to <a href="#Law_45">Law 45</a>),</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>(1) Take up your hand;</p>

<p>(2) Count your cards (see notes to Laws 42 &amp; 46);</p>

<p>(3) Sort them into suits;</p>

<p>(4) Look them over carefully;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>(5) Fix firmly in your memory not only the trump
suit but the trump card, then</p>

<p>(6) Give your undivided attention to the table, <i>it
is there and not in your hand the game is
played</i>;</p>

<p>(7) <i>See every card played in the order it is played</i>;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>(8) When you deal, place the trump card apart
from the rest of the suit, that you may know
at once which it is.</p></div>

<p>N.B.—Knowing is always better than the very best
thinking, and generally much more easy: by these
simple means you get rid at once and for ever of all
such childish interruptions as “draw your card!”
“who led?” “what are trumps?” “show me the last
trick!” and so <i>ad infinitum</i>, which, by their constant
repetition, not merely worry and annoy the rest of
the table, but tend to destroy any clue to the game
that you yourself might otherwise possess.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to sit clear of the table, and
then if you are constrained to drop a few cards, they
at any rate fall on the floor, where they cannot be
called.</p>

<p>So far, I have assumed your object to be Whist; if
your end and aim is Bumblepuppy, you need do none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of these things; you can learn the leads and the
recognised play—more or less imperfectly—in a few
years by practice, or you can leave them unlearned;</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With what materials, on what ground you please.”</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 20.5em;"><i>Cowper.</i></span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">ignorance imparts variety to the game, and variety is
charming. You can set all laws at defiance, and if
any one objects—after much wrangling—you can
refer the matter in dispute to the Westminster
Papers,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and hang it up for a month certain: (this is
a better plan than writing to the <i>Field</i>, for there you
only get a week’s respite).</p>

<p>Should you be in any doubt whether Whist or the
other game is your vocation, the first half-dozen
times you play make it a rule never to look at the
last trick—</p>

<div class="quote">
“Things that are past are done with.”—<i>Shakespeare.</i>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and if at the end of that time you find the difficulty
insuperable, give up, as hopeless, all idea of becoming
a Whist player.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that there are ninety-one laws.
The wording of the first is not strictly accurate; it
ought to be “The rubber is <i>generally</i> the best of
three games,” for though I myself have never seen
more than four, it may consist of any number, as
the following decisions show:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Decision A.</span>—The rubber is over when one side
has won two games and remembers it has done so:
this memory must be brought to bear before the
other side has won two games and remembers it has
done so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Decision B.</span>—If a game is forgotten, it is no part
of the losers’ duty to remind the winners of the fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law 5.</span>—This law is clear enough; still the first
time you revoke and are found out, if your opponents
hold honours and you have nothing scored—however
many you have made by cards—they will claim
a treble: you should be prepared for this. The
claim is wrong, but in spite of that—possibly because
of it—“they all do it.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law 7.—Decision.</span>—You must call your honours
audibly, but you are not obliged to yell because your
adversaries are quarrelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Law_14"></a>Law 14.</span>—Always get hold of the cards before
cutting, and place a high card at one end of the pack
and a low one at the other, then cut last and take
either card you prefer: by this means you select your
partner, this is an admirable coup and tends to the
greatest happiness of the greatest number (<a href="#Footnote_2_2">Note A</a>,
<a href="#Page_2">page 2</a>) but it must be executed with judgment, for
if you are detected your happiness will not be increased,
rather the reverse. Some purists, anxious
to be on the safe side, only keep an eye on the bottom
card, and take it when it suits them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law 34.</span>—Until the last few years, after you had
cut the cards into two distinct packets, if the dealer
thought fit to knock one of them over, leave a card
on the table, or drop half-a-dozen or so about, it
was a mis-deal on the ground that these proceedings
were opposed to one or other of the next two laws,
35 and 36, but the latest decision is that the dealer
can maltreat the pack in any way he likes and as
often as he likes, and compel you to keep on cutting
<i>de die in diem</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Decision.</span>—“You cannot make your adversary
cut a second time; when you left a card on the
table it could not be said that there was a confusion
in the cutting, it is a mis-deal.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Decision.</span>—“There is nothing in the laws to
make this a mis-deal. The play comes under the
term ‘Confusion of the cards,’ and there must be a
fresh deal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>If you see a potent, grave, and reverend seignior
carefully lubricating his thumb with saliva, don’t
imagine he is preparing it for deglutition, he is only
about to deal. Even if he should swallow it, why
interfere? he will not hurt you; it is not your
thumb. Should you suffer from acute hyperæsthesis
you can follow the example of an old friend of mine,
who once rose from the table in his terror, and
returned armed with a large pair of black kid gloves
which he wore during the remainder of the <i>seance</i>:
though the effect was funereal—not to say ghastly—it
was attended with the best results in this case,
but it is just as likely to lead to ill-feeling, and
therefore to be deprecated. Leave the matter to
time! Apart from the cards being glazed with lead,
a single pack has been found to contain a fifth of an
ounce of arsenic, and there is no known antidote.
Even if not immediately fatal, the practice must be
very deleterious. A whist enthusiast with a greater
turn for mathematics than I can lay claim to, has
counted from six to seven thousand bacteria on each
square centimetre of a playing card, and makes this
ghastly deduction: “it is really dreadful to reflect
upon the colony of microbes which a person who
moistens his thumb before dealing may convey into
his mouth, and thence into his system.”—<i>Standard</i>,
Nov. 2nd, 1893. “Everything comes to the man who
can wait,” and while you are waiting <i>always sit on the
dealer’s right</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law 37.</span>—An incorrect or imperfect pack is a pack
containing duplicates or more or less than fifty-two
cards, but it is neither incorrect nor imperfect
because you think fit to place any number of your
own cards in the other pack, or to supplement them
with one from it. <i>Vide</i> Laws 42, 46.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law 42.</span>—If you take <i>one</i> card from the other pack,
it is clear that you subject yourself to a penalty; if
you take more than one the matter is not so clear;
possibly you may gain by it; should you wish to
have the point settled, any time you have a bad hand
add the other pack to it; then complain that you
have sixty-five cards, throw them up, claim a new
deal under Rule 37, and see what comes of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Law_45"></a>Law 45.</span>—Taking up your cards during the deal
has one advantage, that if you can get your hand
sorted and begin to play without waiting for the
dealer, you save time, and time is reported to be
money. To counter-balance this there are two attendant
disadvantages, you prevent the possibility of a
mis-deal, and any card exposed by your officiousness
gives the dealer the option of a new deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law 46.</span>—Under this law it is manifest that—the
other hands being correct—your hand may consist
of any number of cards from one to thirteen, and if
you once play to a trick—however many you may be
short—you will have to find them or be responsible
for them. See Law 70.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Law_91"></a>Law 91.</span>—If this law, which is the main cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
inattention and innumerable improper intimations,
were abolished, Whist would be greatly improved;
and I have never met with a good Whist player who
was not of the same opinion.</p>

<p>The chapter on etiquette is good sense and good
English, and is worthy of much more attention than
is usually given to it.</p>

<p>In addition to their ambiguity and sins of commission,
there is also a sin of omission; there is no
limit as to time, and it seems desirable there should
be; I would suggest—as allowing the hesitating
player reasonable latitude—one of those sand glasses,
supposed to be useful for boiling an egg; there is no
sense in giving him time enough to addle his egg.</p>

<p>Though these laws appear more difficult of access
than I had imagined, they are not the laws of which
the only copy was destroyed by Moses; I have seen
them myself in Clay, Cavendish, and the “Art of
Practical Whist,” and if you are unable to get any
of these works from Mudie’s, there are copies of each
in the British Museum, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>Before or immediately after breakfast is the best
time to play; then, if ever, the intellect is clear, the
attention undistracted; in the afternoon you are
exhausted by the labours of the day, and your
evenings should be devoted to the morrow’s lessons
or a quiet nap (not the round game of that ilk).</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> play of the entire hand often depends upon
the very first card led, and the confidence your
partner has that your lead is correct; whatever then
your original lead may be, let it be a true and—as
far as you can make it so—a simple lead: never lead
an equivocal card—that is one which may denote
either strength or weakness—if you can, lead a card
about which no mistake is possible.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> With the
original lead, follow the books and lead your strongest
suit; if you have nothing at all, do as little mischief
as you can; in this pitiable condition the head of a
short suit—as a knave or a ten—is better than the
lowest or lowest but one of five to the nine; your
partner, when he sees the high card led, knows at
once (assuming he knows anything) that he will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to save the game himself if it can be saved, and will
take the necessary steps to that end. Though there
is ancient and modern authority for this,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I am perfectly
aware that (according to the latest theory) it is
heresy; I am also aware, and the reflection gives me
quite as much pain as the heresy does, that leading a
long weak suit <i>with a bad hand</i> and no cards of re-entry
is a losing game:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3em;">“Such courses are in vain</span></div>
<div class="verse">Unless we can get in again.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">to lead your longest suit when you are neither likely
to get the lead again, nor to make a trick in it if you
do, is a “short and easily remembered rule,” but
is apt to bring its followers to grief; if I do so, I
know perfectly well that after the game is over I shall
probably be left with the two long cards of that suit,
or I may have an opportunity of discarding one or
both of them before that crisis arrives, but this is
not the slightest consolation to me.</p>

<p>While on the subject of heresy, I may as well refer
to another lead which has a special orthodoxy of its
own. In all suits of four or more, containing no sequence,
unless headed by the ace, you either lead the
lowest, or, if you wish particularly to exhibit your
knowledge of the game, the lowest but one; but from
king, knave, ten, &amp;c., you lead the ten, and if your
object is a quiet life, you will continue to do so; if
you want to make tricks the advantage of the lead is
not so clear: if the second player holds ace, queen,
&amp;c., or queen and another, you drive him into
playing the queen, and so lose a trick, which if you
had led your lowest in the usual way, you might not
have done.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Against this you have the set off that by leading
the ten you insure having the king-card of the suit
in the third round, but it is scarcely worth your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
while to go through so much to get so little; for
such a lead pre-supposes your partner to have neither
ace, queen, nor nine, and it is two to one that he
holds one of them; if your partner’s best card is
below the nine, the tricks you will make will be like
angels’ visits, few and far between, whatever you
lead; and why you should take such a desponding
view of an unplayed suit I am not aware. The
advantage of opening a suit in which you hold tenace
is not so great as to oblige you to handicap it by
sending the town-crier round with a bell to proclaim
what that tenace is; <i>late in the hand</i> it is often
advisable to lead the knave.</p>

<p>With ace and four small cards and a bad hand,
when weak in trumps, I have found, from long experience,
the ace to be a losing lead, and being
distinctly of the impression that for the ordinary purposes
of life, 13/4 = 2, as I am not always anxious
to proclaim the exact number of my suit, I generally
lead a small one.</p>

<p>I am aware that the suit does not always go twice,
or even once; but that is the fault of the cards, not
of the equation.</p>

<p>Of course, if, for any wise purpose, you feel you
must have one trick, take it at the first opportunity,
irrespective of Cocker or any other authority.</p>

<p>N.B.—When you, second, third, or fourth player
have won the first trick, whatever you may think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you are <i>not</i> the original leader, and your lead then
should be guided by your own hand; if it is a bad
one you are under no compulsion to open a suit at
all, one suit is already open, go on with that; if it
also is a bad one, one bad suit is a less evil than
two bad suits, or opening a doubtful one in the dark;
return through strength up to declared weakness, or
if it was your partner who led, why should you show a
suit unless you hold a good sequence or strong trumps?
Return his suit, yours will be led sometime; whatever
you won the trick with, he is in a better position to
defend himself as third player than if he had to lead
it again himself.</p>

<p>In returning your partner’s lead, if you had
originally three, you return the higher of the two
remaining cards; in returning through your adversary’s
lead, if you hold the third best and another,
play the small one, for your partner may hold the
second best single and they would fall together.</p>

<p>Whenever you hold a suit with one honour in it, to
lead that suit, if you can avoid it, is about the worst
use you can make of it. Should you fail to see this,
devote ten minutes—not when you are playing whist,
but on some wet half-holiday or quiet Sunday afternoon—to
thinking the matter over; even if you have a
suit of king, queen to three, why not be quiet? If
anybody else opens the suit you will probably make
two tricks, if you open it yourself, probably one;
there is no hurry about it, you can always do that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but why you should go out of your way to lead a suit
in which you hold four to the knave or five to the ten
is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>It is not generally known (or if it is, it is never
acted on, which comes to the same thing) that neither
in the ninety-one laws of whist, nor in any of its
numerous maxims, are you forbidden to play the
third round of a suit, even though the best card is
notoriously held by your opponent. It is a common
delusion to fancy that when a suit is declared against
you, you can prevent it making by leading something
else, whereas you merely postpone the evil day, and
do mischief in the interval. Many feeble whist-players
are unwilling ever to let their opponents
make a single trick; now this is unnecessarily
greedy; under no circumstances, at short whist, is
it imperative to make more than eleven. Allow your
adversary to have two, it amuses him and does not
hurt you.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is less mischievous, generally, to lead a certain losing
card, than to open a fresh suit in which you are very weak.”—<i>What
to Lead</i>, by Cam.</p></div>

<p>With trumps declared against you be particularly
careful how you open new suits; surely when you
have just succeeded in knocking your partner on the
head in one suit, you might give him till the next
hand to recover himself, instead of trying to assault
him again the very next time you get the lead.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>Changing suits is one of the most constant annoyances
you will have to contend against; queer temper,
grumbling, logic, and so on, if sometimes a nuisance,
are sometimes altogether absent, but the determination
to open new suits for no apparent reason—unless
a feeble desire on the part of the leader to see how far
the proceeding will injure his partner can be called
a reason—is chronic.</p>

<p>Never<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> lead a singleton unless you are strong
enough in trumps to defeat any attempt either of
your adversaries or your partner to get them out, in
which case it might be as well to lead them yourself;
whether you lead a sneaker or wait for others to play
the suit, the chance of ruffing is much the same, and
the certainty of making a false lead, and the nearly
equal certainty of deceiving your partner are avoided.</p>

<p>When a singleton comes off it may be nice, it is
certainly naughty; when on the other hand you have
killed your partner’s king, and he has afterwards got
the lead, drawn the trumps, and returned your suit,
should the adversaries make four or five suits in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
you must not be surprised if he gives vent to a few
cursory remarks. To succeed with a singleton, (1)
your partner must win the first trick in the suit, (2)
he must return it at once, (3) on your next opening
another unknown suit, he must again win the trick,
and the odds against these combined events coming
off are something considerable. Per contra, he will
probably be beaten on the very first round, and even
if he is not, it is extremely likely that he will either
lead trumps—unless he is aware of your idiosyncracy,
when he will never know what to do—for what he
naturally imagines is your strong suit, or open his
own; at the same time, just as there are fagots and
fagots, so there are singletons and singletons, and a
queen or knave is by no means such a villainous card
as anything below a seven. “The very worst singleton
is the king.”—<i>Cam.</i></p>

<p>With five trumps and no cards, lead a trump: you
have made a true lead, you have led not merely
your strongest suit, but a very strong suit, and if
your partner has nothing, you will lose the game
whatever you play, but you will lose it on that account,
and not because you led a trump; if you open any of
the plain suits you will make a false lead, and it is
two to one that the adversaries hold any of them
against your partner. You will often be told by the
very people who will tell you to lead from five small
cards in a plain suit, that to lead a trump from five is
too dangerous, but if you inquire in what way it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
too dangerous, and receive any satisfactory reply, you
will succeed in doing what I have never done.</p>

<p>With five trumps and other cards, <i>a fortiori</i> lead a
trump.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the game, you will find it laid
down by some authorities that if you hold nothing
and have an original lead, you should lead your best
trump; now if that trump is of sufficient size to warn
your partner that it is your best, this lead may not,
under the circumstances, be much more injurious
than any other; but an original trump lead is usually
supposed to indicate great strength either in trumps,
or in plain suits, and if your partner infers from the
size of your trump that your lead is from strength,
and acting on that inference returns it, it is about the
most murderous lead that can be made; having been
two or three times the victim of such a lead is almost
as good a reason for not returning trumps as sudden
illness or not having one.</p>

<p>If he holds seven tricks in his own hand he can
make them at any time, and any attempt of yours,
however able, to deceive him at the outset will (to
say the least of it) not assist him in doing so.</p>

<p>Why add an additional element of confusion to the
game? Why should your partner have to say to
himself as well as “Strong cards or strong trumps?”
“Perhaps nothing at all.” He is compelled to wait
about to see what is the meaning of this lead, time is
lost, and an opportunity let slip which may never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
recur. The Bumblepuppist will here observe that
time was made for slaves; but the apophthegms on this
subject are more numerous and contradictory than
he is aware of.</p>

<p>As a general principle, with the original lead and
a very bad hand, it is advisable to efface yourself as
much as possible. In such a case, I always have a
strong desire to get under the table—I don’t know
that it is contrary to either the laws or the etiquette
of whist to do so—and I firmly believe it is a better
course than leading the trey of trumps; at any rate
it is not for the weak hand to dictate how the game
should be played; and to step boldly to the front and
lead a small trump from two, without a trick behind
it, is in my opinion the height of impertinence.</p>

<p>At certain states of the score it may be imperative,
in order to save the game, that you should place all
the remaining cards, but that is another matter
altogether, and if you want to go into it, read Clay
on the subject (page 85), though he nowhere suggests
that you should commence operations by placing
thirty-eight unknown cards.</p>

<p>If your partner has led you a trump, and you—holding
ace, queen, to four or more—have made
the queen, return the ace; if you are playing
Bumblepuppy return a small one, your partner
thinking the ace is against him, is almost certain
to finesse and lose a trick—then call him names.
The reason assigned by the perpetrator of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
return is that as he originally held four he is
<i>compelled</i> to play the lowest, and it curiously
exemplifies his inability to apply even the little
knowledge he is possessed of.</p>

<p>With ace, king only, it is customary to lead first
the ace and then the king; there is no authority for
such a lead,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and nothing to be gained by it, except
that by leading in this way you probably prevent
your partner from signalling in the suit, but if you
like to burden yourself with a useless anomaly, you
can make a note of it. We started with the
hypothesis, that, in the ordinary course of nature,
you have fifty years before you, and if you wish to
embitter and shorten those years, you will invariably
lead the lowest but one of five—it may be, and I
am informed is, useful among a few assorted players,
“chock-full of science,” but it is caviare to the
general<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and (unlike Wordsworth’s Creature)—</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>For my part I only think it expedient to show
five when, with reasonable strength on the part of
my partner, I have a fair prospect of bringing in
the suit.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It is often better to keep the knowledge of mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
length of suit religiously to yourself. Length and
strength are not always the same thing; why are
giants generally so weak about the knees? Length
is often only one element of strength and a very poor
one at that, though it may be of use indirectly.
With four or five low cards and an observant
opponent, it is occasionally a good plan to bottle up
the smallest. I have known this missing link so to
prey upon that opponent’s mind as to cause him to
forget matters of much greater importance.</p>

<p>In bumblepuppy all this is entirely different, you
can lead anything you like, in any way you like;
here the safest lead is a long weak suit, the longer
and weaker it is, the less is your partner able to do
you a mischief. <i>With a weak partner</i>, strengthening
cards are either futile or dangerous: as he will in
all probability at once disembowel himself, the result
of leading them is on all fours with the Japanese
Hari Kari; whereas if you lead him a small card he
will finesse into his boots.</p>

<p>You should also be very particular to lead the
lowest but one of five,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> it creates confusion, and under
cover of that confusion you may make a trick or two.
From this point of view you will often find the lead
of the middle card of your suit extremely effective.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>As to play false cards for the purpose of deceiving
your partner is considered clever, a very little practice
will enable you to play them with facility. With all
deference to Bret Harte, for ways that are dark, the
Heathen Chinee is <i>not</i> particular, and for tricks that
are vain, the Caucasian can give him points.</p>

<p>If you read your Natural History, you will find it
is the weaker animals which betake themselves to
anomalous modes of defence; though the cuttle-fish
and the skunk may be much looked up to in their
respective domestic circles, they are quite out of
place at the whist-table.</p>

<p>It is also usual with ace to five or more trumps
to lead the ace, and if you see—by killing your
partner’s king, or by his failing to play one—that
he has no more, to try something else, for you can
change the suit as often as you please. It is a
fine mental exercise for your partner to recollect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
remaining cards of four unfinished suits, all going
simultaneously.</p>

<p>I often think, when I see this game in full blast,
that whist-players are not sufficiently grateful to
Charles the Sixth, or whatever other lunatic invented
playing cards, for having limited himself to four
suits; he might have devised six—but the idea is
too horrible. “In the time of Charles the Sixth
there were five suits.”—<i>Field.</i> This not only proves
my ignorance but my position, for if five suits have
been tried and found too much for human endurance,
then six would manifestly have been quite too awful!

<h2>LECTURE III.<br />

——<br />

<small>THE PLAY OF THE SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH
HAND.</small><br />

——</h2>

<div class="center">
<small>“The play is the thing.”—<i>Shakespeare.</i></small><br />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Second</span> hand with king and another, or queen and
another, never play the honour either in trumps
or plain suits, unless you particularly want the lead,
and then you will probably not get it, and throw
away a trick.</p>

<p>By not playing the honour,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) The chance of trick-making in the suit is
greater (this has been proved to demonstration
by Mogul).<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>(2) The possible weakness of the third hand is
exposed—a very important point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Your own weakness is concealed from the
leader, and he is able to finesse against
your partner; these three reasons ought to
be tolerably conclusive, but if a high card
is led, head it!</p></div>

<p>If, holding knave, ten, and another, you are
afraid of trumps being led, and your partner is
devoid of common sense, don’t play the ten, or it
will be taken for a signal (that it neither is one, nor
at all like one, does not affect the petrolater in the
least); it is almost equally dangerous with queen,
knave, and another to play the knave. A high
card second hand has exactly the same effect on
many players as a red rag has on a bull; and if you
have an objection to being gored, you should keep
it out of their sight as long as possible—subject to
this important qualification—“Put an honour on an
honour, with only three of a suit; with four or more
you should not do it.”—<i>Mathews.</i></p>

<p>Except to save or win the game, whether you
are weak in trumps, or strong, don’t ruff a doubtful
card unless you have a distinct idea what to do
next; if you are only going to open a weak suit, let
it go.</p>

<p>Don’t ruff a suit of which your partner clearly
holds the best, in order to announce, <i>urbi et orbi</i>,
that you are weak in trumps; depend upon it <i>urbis</i>
and <i>orbis</i> will take advantage of this, not to mention
that you take the lead out of your partner’s hand at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a critical moment, and prevent him from developing
any game that he may have.</p>

<div class="quote">“Why for the momentary trick be perdurably fined?”—<i>Shakespeare.</i></div>

<p>In bumblepuppy, with ace, king, and others, or
king, queen, and others, the trick is often passed,
and with knave led, if the second player holds ace,
queen, etc., he usually plays the queen;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> holding
the same cards, if instead of the knave a small card
is led, he occasionally produces the ace. These
proceedings may be the eccentricities of genius; if
they are not, the only other explanation I can suggest
for them, is a desire to lose a trick.</p>

<p>Third hand.—Don’t finesse against your partner,
unless you have reason to believe you are stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in his own suit than he is, or that he has led from
weakness.</p>

<p>Don’t finesse against yourself. If you have led
from ace, knave, etc., and your partner has made
the queen, the king is certainly not on your right.
If, on the other hand, you have led from king, and
your partner again has made the queen, it can be
of no use to put on the king, the ace must be over
you. Though Clay described the finesse obligatory
before you were thought of, I am afraid that after
you are forgotten, these two simple cases will continue
to be reversed—that people will finesse against, and
not for, themselves. In bumblepuppy this is <i>de
rigueur</i>; also at this game, with king, queen, and
another in your partner’s lead, it is customary to play
the king, and, if it wins, to open a new suit.</p>

<p>Ruff a winning card of the adversaries! What
possible benefit can you derive from allowing your
opponent to discard, and by that discard show his
partner the suit he wishes led? If you are too stingy
to use a high trump, surely you might play a little
one just to keep the trick going. “It is much better
to play a small trump with the certainty it will be
overtrumped than to let the trick go.”—<i>Westminster
Papers.</i></p>

<p>When your partner has opened a suit with the ace,
and on the third round eleven are out, he holds the
other two, and whenever he leads one of them—whether
it is the queen or the four—it is a winning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
card; but if you fail to grasp this, and feel disposed
to play the thirteenth trump on it, don’t waste time
either in invoking the immortal gods, inspecting the
last trick, or looking præternaturally intelligent—trump
it at once, and put him out of his misery. The
idea is not new, for it occurred to Macbeth when
about to perpetrate the very same coup:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If ’twere done when ’tis done, then ’twere well</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">It were done quickly.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">My only claim is to have expressed myself without
such an involved use of auxiliary verbs.</p>

<p>If you have more than two of the suit, don’t play
the ace on your partner’s knave; it may be a short
suit, or the head of a sequence, and you throw away
the power of passing the ten second round, even if it
is from king, queen, knave to five, there is nothing to
be gained by covering; with ace and another win the
trick and return it at once, unless you lead trumps.</p>

<p>Though frequently done, it is not good whist to
decline to win a trick, either on the ground that you
want a guard for your king of trumps, or because you
hold six. In the other game both these proceedings
would be correct.</p>

<p>Fourth hand.—Win the trick, and endeavour, if
possible, to do so without playing a false card. Like
all things that are difficult at first, you will find it
become comparatively easy by practice. You might
suppose that the exponent of bumblepuppy—who
always considers a trick of his own making worth at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
least two made by his partner—would get into no
difficulty here; but he does. He has a firmly-rooted
belief that his strong suits are under the protection of
a special Providence which will never allow them to
be ruffed, and uttering his wretched shibboleth,
“Part with my ace, sir? never!” he contrives to lose
any number of tricks by keeping up his winning
cards to the last possible moment and a shade longer.
I imagine he is under the erroneous impression that
this in some way compensates for cutting in with a
small trump when he is not wanted.</p>

<p>“It is a good plan when you have the thirteenth
trump to pass winning cards. The reason of this is
not apparent, but in practice I know several players
who do so, and in the multitude of counsellors there
is wisdom.”—<i>Westminster Papers.</i></p>

<h2>LECTURE IV.<br />

——<br />

<small>DISCARDING, AND ITS DIFFICULTIES.</small><br />

——</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“This the vain purpose of his life to try,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Still to explore what still eludes his eye.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Discards</span> are of two distinct kinds:—</p>


<ul class="booklist">
<li>(1) Ordinary.</li>
<li>(2) Forced.</li>
</ul>

<p>(1) When your partner; (2) When your adversary
shows strength.</p>

<p>In the first case, you naturally point out to your
partner which is your strong suit by discarding from
your weak suits, your object being to win the game,
and there is an end of that matter.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In the second
case it is just the reverse. You have to save the game,
and you discard from your <i>best guarded suit</i>, by no
means necessarily your strongest, with a view, as far
as you can, of blocking every suit, and so preventing
the adversary from establishing his long cards.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>These two kinds of discards are, or ought to be,
of importance to three very different classes of
players:—</p>

<p>(1) The Scientific.</p>

<p>(2) The Commonly Decent.</p>

<p>(3) The Exponents of Bumblepuppy.</p>

<p>(1) The Scientific.—Here, with trumps declared
against you, you discard, as already said, from your best
guarded suit. Your partner knows this is probable,
but he does not know how strong you are in that suit;
he also knows it may very possibly be a suit in which
you hold three small cards, and a second discard of
it only gives him the further information that you had
either three or five—<i>he must infer which from his own
hand</i>—he assumes you did not originally hold two,
for you would not have left yourself entirely bare of
the suit. It is not everybody who is in the proud
position which I once occupied, when a trump being
led by the adversary, I found myself with no trump,
the best nine cards of one suit, and two other aces.</p>

<p>Among good players, then, the forced discard
amounts to this: that though you are aware your
partner is discarding with the best possible motives,
and he is aware that you are doing the same, neither
can depend upon the other’s discard as showing anything
for certain. With trumps declared against you,
you must place unknown cards to the best of your
ability, and in such an unpleasant conjuncture, if you
are exceptionally fortunate, you may sometimes save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the game, and the skill displayed in doing so may be
a joy for ever:—</p>

<div class="center">
<small>“Forsan et hæc olim meminisse juvabit.”</small>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Observe the discretion of the poet in his choice of the
word “<i>forsan</i>.”</p>

<p>But when, on the other hand, you look at the improbability
of this coming off, when you reflect that
your partner has occasionally given you two discards,
and that you, in the exercise of that right of private
judgment inherent in every Protestant, led one of
those very suits, and by so doing lost the game;
when you recall what then took place, the <i>epea
pteroenta</i>, the mutual—but the subject is too painful;
let us leave it, and pass on to Class 2.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This class
has two divisions, they both see your discards, but—without
any reference to their own hands or anything
that has been played—one division assumes your discard
is invariably from weakness, and at once knocks
on the head the very suit you have sedulously
been attempting to guard; the other has got hold
of the pernicious axiom that the original discard
is necessarily your <i>strongest</i> suit, and always leads
that.</p>

<p>Here we have again a pretty considerable element
of confusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>Class 3.—These, with an unerring instinct that
might almost be mistaken for genius,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> will put you
in a hole, whatever you do. The safest plan is,
under all circumstances, to discard from your
weakest suit; you cannot be cut to pieces there,
and, whatever happens, you have the letter of the law
on your side. When you have not followed suit to
the second round of the opponent’s trumps, when,
as a rule, your discard (being forced) is not to be
depended on and is of no importance to them, this
is the only time they ever see it; for having no
winning cards in their own hands to attract their
attention, they are able to devote a little more time
to seeing the cards on the table. The number of
times they will have that wretched trick turned, and
their anxiety to be quite sure of the suit, are painful
to the sensitive mind (especially if that sensitive
mind is sitting opposite to them and happens to
belong to yourself). Well might Sophocles observe,
“Many things are dreadful, but nothing is more
dreadful than man.”</p>

<p>That the first discard is from the weakest suit is
one of those half-dozen cast-iron rules—three of them
wrong, and the remainder invariably misapplied—which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
make up their stock-in-trade;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but if they
hold ace, king, queen to five trumps—say clubs—you
see them come well up to the table with an air
of triumph, and begin to lead. Again you don’t
follow suit; what do they care? they drive gaily
on, but, as they finish the third round, the idea
just begins to dawn upon them—perhaps you have
discarded something.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> A careful inspection of the
last trick affords them the pleasing intelligence that
somebody has discarded a diamond and somebody
else a spade; the light fades from their eye, their jaw
drops, and they are such a picture of hopeless misery,
that if they were not in the habit of informing you—scores
of times a day—that they play whist only for
amusement, you might almost doubt the fact.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>After prolonged contemplation of the chandelier
and a farewell look at the spade and diamond, they
eventually produce a heart—your original discard!—have
their remaining trumps drawn, and lose the
game.</p>

<p>Ordinary discards are simple in the extreme, and
might be very useful; unfortunately (as the general
public will persist in confining its attention to its
own hand, as long as there is anything in it), the
only discard usually seen is the last, and this detracts
from their utility. Forced discards are always
difficult (not to the discarder, but to his partner), and
to a duffer, unintelligible, for this reason, they require
common-sense—far be it from me to teach it—it is
like poetry, “<i>nascitur non fit</i>,” and these remarks
have not been made with any such intention, but
to endeavour to accentuate that Cavendish in his
treatise on Whist, and a letter which I append, has
said everything on the subject likely to be of use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The Principles of Discarding.</i></h3>

<p>“The old system of discarding, though unscientific,
had at least the merit of extreme simplicity. It was
just this: when not able to follow suit, let your first
discard be from your weakest suit. Your partner in
his subsequent leads is thus directed to your strong
suit, and will refrain from leading the suit in which,
by your original discard, you have told him you
are weak.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Several years ago some whist enthusiasts, amongst
whom were Mogul and myself, played a number of
experimental rubbers, the cards of each hand being
recorded as they were played, and the play being
fully discussed afterwards.</p>

<p>In the course of the discussion it was observed
first, I think, by Mogul, that in several hands the
discard from a weak suit, when the adversaries
evidently had in their hands the command of trumps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
had resulted very disastrously.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This caused us to
consider whether the weak suit should not be
protected under these circumstances, and we finally
came to the conclusion that discards should be
divided into two classes, viz., ordinary discards and
forced discards. These I proceed to distinguish.</p>

<p>The reason a weak suit is chosen for the discard is,
that when a strong suit is broken into, the number of
long cards which might be brought in, if the suit is
ever established, are lessened, and so many potential
tricks are thus consequently lost.</p>

<p>But little harm, certainly none of this kind of harm,
is done by throwing away from a weak suit, in other
words, from a suit that can never be brought in. But
when the adversaries have declared great strength in
trumps, the chance of bringing in a suit is reduced to
a minimum. On the assumption that you can never
bring it in, the small cards of your long suit are
valueless to you. That suit will protect itself so far
as its high cards are concerned, but the weak suits
require protection.</p>

<p>Thus, by guarding honours, or by keeping four
cards to a ten or nine, a trick is often won, or the
establishment of an adverse suit prevented. It was
this point, indeed, which first led us to condemn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
invariable discard of the weak suit; the remark was
frequently made, “I was obliged to deceive you then,
partner, and to throw my long suit in order to keep
my king guarded in another suit.” This, of course,
when the game was in danger.</p>

<p>Honours in weak suits may be freely unguarded by
the players who have strong trump hands, but the
guards should be religiously preserved by those who
are weak. Our discussions resulted in our laying
down the following rules for our own guidance, viz.,
<i>when you see from the fall of the cards that there is no
probability of bringing in your own or your partner’s
long suit, discard originally from your best protected suit</i>.
This I may call the foundation of the modern system
of discarding; it has been adopted by all the best
players with whom I am acquainted.</p>

<p>For the sake of having a short and easily remembered
rule, however, it is the fashion to say, “Discard
originally from your strong suit when the adversaries
lead trumps.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> “No doubt you will be right in your
discard in most cases, but this aphorism does not
truly express the conditions.” (Query, then why use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
it?).... “The conclusion I have arrived at
is that the modern system of discarding requires so
much judgment in its application as to be rather a
stumbling-block than an assistance to the ordinary
run of players,”—rough on the neophyte!—“This is
a pity, as there can be no doubt but that the classing
of discards into ordinary and forced is sound in principle,
and adds beauty to the game. I have been
prompted to write this letter in the hopes of seeing
this classification more generally adopted, and its
limitations more distinctly observed and acted on.”—<i>Cavendish.</i></p>

<p>I have met with the same conclusion and the same
regret in a metrical form: it is short, and may be
useful to any of you troubled with bad memories:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Playing for Amusement.</span></h4>

<p>If this principle were carried out to its logical
result, and everybody played for amusement in the
ludicrous sense in which this word is generally understood,
it is manifest that—as no one would ever see
either a card led or played, or know what suit was
trumps—it would be useless continuing to ask each
other for information on those abstruse points; and
unless, by some alteration in the laws of whist, an
intelligence department outside the table were
provided to supplement the precarious knowledge
acquired by looking at the last trick, the game would
shortly collapse from its innate absurdity; unfortunately
we seldom arrive at this point; what usually
takes place is this:</p>

<p>Four people sit down nominally to play whist, when
suddenly one of them announces, to the consternation
of his partner, that he is not there with any such intention,
but solely for his own amusement; he
altogether ignores the possibility of the others wishing
to play whist for their amusement, and lays down
his stale proposition with such an air of originality
that he often deludes the unwary bystander into the
belief that he is somehow superhuman, and much
superior to the other three, who are consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
looked down upon as mean and sordid individuals;
this is not the case. If yelling when he is trodden
upon, and crying if he loses, are proofs of humanity,
he is essentially human.</p>

<p>Now, no one has the slightest objection to your
amusing yourself as long as you do not annoy anybody
else. I go further than this, and admit your
abstract right to amuse yourself at your partner’s
expense, but I protest against your expecting him to
rejoice with you in his own discomfiture.</p>

<p>Because eels are accustomed to being skinned, it
does not at all follow that they should like it—at any
rate, whether they do so or not, it is not expected of
them.</p>

<p>Again, the practice of vivisection may be both
amusing and instructive to the vivisector, while it
may be neither the one nor the other to his victim.
Though I have no practical acquaintance with this
pursuit, I have often seen large portraits of the vivisectee
pasted on hoardings, and judging from the
expression of his countenance, and the uncomfortable
position in which he is always depicted, I should
imagine that the entire proceedings were supremely
distasteful to him.</p>

<p>From the time when Cain was short-coated, and
tipcats, pea-shooters, catapults, and other instruments
of torture appeared on the scene, there have been
peculiar ideas of amusement. Fortunately—with the
exception of your doting mammas—public opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
has been against you. A gentleman found in the
street with a tipcat embedded in his eye is usually
conducted to the nearest chemist, and the malefactor
given in charge. (The crafty Ulysses, before he performed
a very similar operation on Polyphemus, made
every preparation to escape from the room as soon as
it was over, and took uncommonly good care not to
originate the now trite witticism, “there you go with
your eye out,” till he was well beyond his reach. He
was far too intelligent a man to expect the Cyclops to
take it pleasantly.) But if this occurs at Whist, and
the victim even hints an objection, he is looked upon
as a bear, and sometimes the verdict is “served him
right,” while at other times he seems to be expected
to “rub it in.” There I draw the line; annoy your
partner as much as you like, but don’t expect that!
It is contrary to nature; still, while fully and freely
admitting your right of annoying, and also your
right to throw away your own property if you please,
you are not privileged to treat your partner’s in the
same way. This borders closely on theft, and before
taking such a liberty, in order to be on the safe side,
I think you ought first to obtain his consent in
writing. It is all very well for Shakespeare to call
his purse trash (he knew the contents of it, and his
description may have been most accurate), but whether
things are trash or not, if they don’t belong to you,
you must not make away with them (as the poet himself
experienced when he took to deer-stealing), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
unless you wish, like him, to fall into the clutches of
the criminal law, you had better take Captain Cuttle’s
advice, and overhaul your catechism, with special
reference to your duty to your neighbour. You will
find it a safer guide.</p>

<p>I ought to apologise for the length of this note,
but I have suffered myself, and although I never
killed an albatross, and am by nature most inoffensive,</p>

<h2>LECTURE V.<br />

——<br />

<small>THE DISCARD FROM THE <i>STRONGEST</i> SUIT.</small><br />

——</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen
ademptum.”—<i>Eton Grammar.</i></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part I.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> last lecture went thoroughly into the forced
discard and, after looking at it in every possible
light, left it exactly at the point where it was left by
Mathews nearly a hundred years ago: “<span class="smcap">If weak in
trumps, keep guard on your adversary’s suits.
If strong, throw away from them and discard
as much as possible from your partner’s strong
suits in either case.</span>”</p>

<p>Here I should gladly have let the matter rest—as
the boy said when he saw the wild cat. It is a
thorny subject; but the New Man will not permit it.</p>

<p>“<i>The Decline and Fall of Whist</i>” contains a view of
him and his game, which is very widely entertained
in this country, and though it may or may not be a
better game, it is not Whist in the English sense of
the word.</p>

<p>Our subject being the Whist or Bumblepuppy of
our native land, the invariable lead of the longest suit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fourth-bests, eleven rule, American leads, and all the
subsequent proceedings have no more interest for the
British school-boy wishing to learn Whist than they
had for Abner Dean of Angels on a well-known
occasion.</p>

<p>To give the American Whist-players their due, I
am bound to admit that, in addition to their having
devised a new set of leads, new play of second and
third hand, a new mode of scoring, and having done
away with the honours—greatly to their credit for
common sense and intelligence; their idea of our
modern forced discard is: “It is a curious notion that
an original discard should always be from the strongest
suit” (<i>A Practical Guide to Whist, by Fisher Ames</i>),
and also they have compiled a new code of laws
which is an enormous improvement upon the singular
jumble of laws, definitions, and arbitrary decisions
under which we impotently writhe.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“On ashes, husks, and air we feed,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And spend our little all in vain.”—<i>Wesley.</i></span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Law 37 of their code runs as follows: “When a
trick is turned and quitted it must not be seen again
until the hand has been played. A violation of this
law subjects the offending side to the same penalty as
a lead out of turn.”</p>

<p>They may have been driven to abolish our <a href="#Law_91">Law 91</a>
in order to make the intricacies of their game humanly
possible, still, “for this relief much thanks.”</p>

<p>Considering the cheapness of freight, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
there is no import duty, why Law 37 has not been
introduced into this country is one of the greatest
mysteries of the end of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>We are flooded with all the other American Whist
innovations, and the key of the position is conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p>“Why should English Whist-men retain an antiquated,
ill-constructed and ambiguous code, when
they have in the code of the American Whist League
laws as free from such defects as human ingenuity
can devise?”—<i>Whist.</i> And echo answers, Why?</p>

<p>But to return to our muttons. On one point it is
incumbent to make a stand. If the New Man had
only been satisfied to concentrate his mischievous
attentions on his New Game, we might have agreed
to differ and gone our several ways in peace and
harmony: <i>dis aliter visum</i>. Unfortunately, “in his
craze for uniformity,” he has tampered with the
forced discard, which is our common grazing ground,
and has deluded himself and the whole of Bumblepuppydom
into a wild and erroneous belief that the
first discard—when unable to follow suit to an adverse
trump lead—is <i>always</i> the suit he wants led.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">“In all the fabric</span></div>
<div class="verse">You shall not see one stone or a brick,</div>
<div class="verse">But all of wood.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, I have dealt myself innumerable hands—it is
a favourite amusement of mine when I have a little
spare time—and taking the shortest and weakest suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
for trumps, have carefully calculated how often I
could discard a suit I wanted led; how often I should
feel justified in dictating to my partner to make me
third player in it. It comes out well under fifty per
cent.</p>

<p>Hands of this kind are constantly turning up.</p>

<p>Diamonds (trumps)—9, 7.</p>

<p>Hearts—Kg., Qn., 3.</p>

<p>Spades—Qn., Kn., 9.</p>

<p>Clubs—10, 8, 6, 3, 2.</p>

<p>Here I must discard a club, but I don’t necessarily
want it led.</p>

<p>Diamonds (trumps)—Qn. and another.</p>

<p>Hearts—Kn. and three small ones.</p>

<p>Spades—Kn. and three small ones.</p>

<p>Clubs—Three small ones.</p>

<p>As I am not going to unguard either of these
knaves, again I discard a club, and again I don’t
want to dictate to my partner to lead it, and so <i>ad
infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>The simple faith that, whenever the adversary leads
trumps, you are bound to hold a strong suit, may be
better than Norman blood. If it is, it only tends to
prove of how singularly little value that fluid may be.</p>

<p>Therefore, in my own case, this is the way the rule
works out: “When we are in a very tight place, and
trumps are declared against us, my first discard
<i>always</i> shows clearly the suit I want led;” only, in more
than half the instances, it does nothing of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a pretty sort of universal rule. Whatever
view you may take of it, it scarcely comes up to my
idea of a sheet anchor.</p>

<p>But if I prefer to wallow there, don’t let me thrust
my opinions on you—you may object to mud; your
cards may be better than mine; judge for yourselves!
Deal a few hands, and if you find once in five times,
or once in ten times, that the rule won’t work, then
you have this formula for your guidance: “We
always discard from the suit we want led, <i>except when
we have no such suit</i>,” and mind this, the first time
you fail, all the fat is in the fire; there is no retreat.
When once you cast judgment and common-sense to
the four winds of heaven, and submit yourselves body
and soul to the rule of thumb—and such a thumb!—you
cannot play fast and loose with it; you must take
it for “all in all, or not at all.” Like a wife, which
you may have some day, you take it for better or

it is an utterly unworkable arrangement,</p>

from your <i>longest</i> suit a safer plan, though this is not
always available. Why cannot you leave good old

<p>After all I have said, should you still persist in

“touch the spot”—</p>

<div class="quote">“Post tenebras lux.”—<i>Pintsch.</i></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> is one method of forced discarding which
is often extremely useful; it is simple to a
degree and always practicable; it has been in use
for some years, and is approved of by all the good
whist-players I have ever come across.</p>

<p>If you have a really strong suit to discard from—a
suit that you <i>can</i> order your partner to lead you—<i>signal
in it</i>, and throw away the highest card you
safely dare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>This was first brought to my notice by Mr. Proctor,
and—like Newton’s apple, Columbus’s egg, and many
other great discoveries—is almost obtrusively obvious
when it is once pointed out.</p>

<p>It is no new invention, for it has been the well-known
practice of whist from primæval times.</p>

<p>Possibly known in the cave of Neanderthal.</p>

<p>Its inhabitants, when they had a really powerful
suit, discarded an unnecessarily high card. With a
quint major, they discarded the ace; with a quart to
a king, they discarded the king, and so forth.</p>

<p>Here is a declaration of absolute strength at the
very moment it is required; no uncertainty as to
whether it is a protective discard, or mere length; it
is also flexible,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> for you can use your own judgment;
give the information; conceal it for a time if you
think fit, or withhold it altogether.</p>

<p>Minor details—such as that when only one discard
is available, a high card would in all probability
indicate strength, while a low one (though it might
indicate length) would do nothing of the kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
but rather the opposite; and its use under many
circumstances, even when your partner is leading
trumps—if not at once obvious to your own unassisted
intelligence, are better left to the professional
development-mongers.</p>

<p>Having a rooted antipathy to formulating an interminable
series of minute regulations for exceptional
cases, a practice which has done irreparable injury
to whist, far be it from me to trench upon their
preserve.</p>

<p>The convention I have shown to be venerable, and
I believe it to be perfectly legitimate.</p>

<p>Here I begin to tread upon delicate ground, for
though whist is entirely made up of conventions,
many different views are held as to what a convention
is (see note page 60), and when it is and is not
legitimate.</p>

<p>Between the Albert Club and the Bloomsbury back
parlour there is a great gulf fixed—</p>

<div class="quote">
“<i>Virginibus puerisque canto</i>,”
</div>

<p class="unindent">and it would be a life-long regret to me if I seduced
them from the paths of rectitude.</p>

<p>Still, for practical purposes, I should imagine that
a mode of play which is known, or open to be known
by all players, and which contravenes neither the
laws nor the etiquette of whist, fulfils all the necessary
conditions; at all events, it satisfies my moral sense.</p>

<p>If, in addition, it is conducive to trick making,—as
it undoubtedly is—I hail it with effusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>With innumerable treatises; treatises on developments,
on counting number, on exceptional play;
treatises philosophical and treatises mathematical;
with exercises in simple addition; with arrangements
for exorcising superfluous winning cards as elaborate
as if winning cards were enemies of the human race,
and a direct emanation from the evil one, the time
has arrived, if possible, to import a little common-sense
into the game, and to make an effort to win an
occasional trick.</p>

<h2>LECTURE VI.<br />

——<br />

<small>THE ELEVEN RULE (<i>by desire</i>).</small><br />

——</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Three wise men of Gotham</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Went to sea in a bowl;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If the bowl had been stronger</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My tale had been longer.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> lecture, though quite irrelevant, is given to
gratify the curiosity of many youthful enquirers.</p>

<p>The eleven rule (which only applies to American
leads) is simply this: that, if under favourable
circumstances, you add certain integers together
and the result should be eleven, then you shall see
what you shall see. (It can scarcely be called a
novelty, for it seems to have been well known to
Virgil,</p>

<div class="quote">
“Magnus ab integro sœclorum nascitur ordo.”)
</div>

<p>Bearing this cardinal fact firmly in mind, supposing
a deuce is led—and it is <i>ex rei necessitate</i> a fourth
best; this is the favourable circumstance just referred
to—then, if you hold nine higher cards of the suit,
you add nine to the pips on the deuce, and if you add
it correctly and it comes to eleven, you play the
lowest of your superior cards, and (with the proviso
the suit is trumps) win the trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Though it is scarcely an epoch-making discovery,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
still it is true, and that in these days of the new
journalism is something to be thankful for.</p>

<p>There is one example of this rule in the “Field”
which is to me a source of perennial joy.</p>

<p>The second player who holds the ace, the king, the
queen, the knave, and the eight of hearts, to his own
enquiry which card he ought to play on the six led,
replies, “I say the eight!”</p>

<p>Now, though certainly 6 + 5 = 11, and the rule—as
I have already admitted—is true, this play does not
commend itself to my intelligence, and I should
advise you not to trouble your youthful brains about
the later rounds of a plain suit—when the leader, to
your own certain knowledge, has from four to eight,
and you yourself follow holding five, including a quart
major. If you win the first four tricks in it, you
will do as much as you can reasonably expect, and
will have done enough for glory.</p>

<p><i>O sancta simplicitas!</i> That eight, so innocently
stepping to the front, has done more to reconcile me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to human nature than anything that was ever done
by Jonas Chuzzlewit.</p>

<p>May it continue to retain its evergreen faith unspotted
of the world!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“May no ill dreams disturb its rest,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No deeds of darkness it molest,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and that it may never be rudely awakened to find a
serpent in its Eden, and the harmless looking six a
singleton, is my fervent prayer.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that this kind of thing is not
whist as played in this country, and it is by no means
certain it will long be the whist of any country; for
I hear that in the American Whist Club of Boston,
“they have now quite chucked the American leads,”
and one of the later Cavendishes has propounded this
singular view; “I have the craze for giving information
in such an acute form that I should like to be
allowed to show my whole hand to the whole table
before the first lead, on the condition that my cards
are not to be called.” I presume all the hands must
be exposed, otherwise this is merely an offer to back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his partner against his two opponents at single
dummy, and there is nothing particularly sporting
in that.</p>

<p>If, then, this doctrine and position is a rule of faith
and not merely a pious opinion—and pious opinions
have a nasty knack of becoming extended into
principles—the devotees of the new game will, it is
to be hoped, at once relegate its uninviting literature
to the nearest dust-bin, and all with one accord, in
pairs (like the wooden animals in your Noah’s ark),
betake themselves to double-dummy; where, happily,
elaborate schedules of leads are not required; where
extensions of principle are unknown, and where
“faith is lost in sight.”</p>

<h2>LECTURE VII.<br />

<small>THE PETER AND ITS PECULIARITIES.</small><br />

——</h2>

<div class="quote">
“Petrus nimium admiratur se.”—<i>Eton Grammar.</i><br />
<br />
“The base vulgar do call.”—<i>Shakespeare.</i>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago a simple piece of mechanism, to
which somehow or other very undue importance
has been attached, was introduced to the Whist
world; you play a higher card before a lower one—unnecessarily—to
indicate that you hold good trumps,
and <i>want them out</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>You can want this for two reasons:</p>

<p>(1) Because you have the seven best trumps. There
is no objection to your signalling here, though it is
quite uncalled for; if you have the game in your own
hand, you can either lead the lowest but two of six,
stand on your head, or execute any other—what it is
the odd fashion to call—convention the authority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the day may think fit to invent, as long as you do not
come into collision with law 5.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>(2) Because you have a good trump hand, and the
fall of the cards shows that unless you get them
out, your winning cards or your partner’s will be
ruffed. Here is a good legitimate reason, but when
everything is going nicely, and your partner making
the tricks, that you should interfere with this merely
because you have five trumps—or nine for the matter
of that—is the height of absurdity. It may be an interesting
fact for him to know, on the second round
of a plain suit, that you hold five trumps, just as there
are numerous other interesting facts which he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
also ascertain at the same time, <i>e.g.</i>, that you have led
a singleton, that you hold no honour in your own
suit, and so on, but none of them justifies him in
ruining his own hand and devoting his best trump to
destruction.</p>

<p>You ought to understand the signaller to say, “Get
the lead at any cost the first moment you can, play
your highest trump, and you shall see something
remarkable.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>This is rather a large order, and when you find as
the result of your best attempts to execute it, that
that promised something is not uncommonly the loss
of the rubber, though it will be a shock to you at first,
you will soon get accustomed to it.</p>

<p>It is even a dangerous practice to signal when the
adversaries will most likely have the lead on its completion;
they at once adapt their play to the circumstances.
I have seen innumerable games of whist
not won, and many a game lost, by absurd signalling;
still Whist players suffering from Peter on the brain
constantly refuse to ruff a winning card in order to
disclose a signal in the discard. If they wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
trumps led, it occurs to the ordinary mind that the
simplest plan would be to win the trick and lead
them, and as they decline to do so, the only conclusion
is that they regard signalling for the mere sake of
signalling to be in itself so noble an end that, to
attain it, it is worth while to announce to their
opponents that they had better save the game at once,
and at the same time to present them with at least
one trick towards it.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="quote">
“O scenes surpassing fable, and yet true.”<br />
“By Heaven! he echoes.”—<i>Othello.</i><br />
</div>

<p>If you only want the odd trick, signalling is about
the safest way to miss it. Any two decent players
would, in a vast majority of cases, get on exactly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
well if the Peter had never been invented, while two
bad players—assuming they can possibly miss the
game with all the trumps—generally do so by its
assistance.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Where it would be useful is when, with
moderate strength in trumps, and the cards declared
in your favour, you want trumps led at all hazards.
Unfortunately, if at such a crisis as this, your partner
is not equal to leading them without a call, he is certain
not to see it, although he is missing all the other
points of the game in what he calls looking for it.
This looking for a Peter is an oddly-named and
peculiar form of amusement appertaining not only
to Bumblepuppy, but also to Whist. Among all
those people who have attended the University Boat
Race during the last half-century, I apprehend not
one went to look for it, they went to see it, and just
as you would see that race, so you should see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
signal. Never look <i>for</i> it! look <i>at</i> it! It is just as
obvious as any other circumstance that occurs in
the play; instead of this, after much looking, it is
generally overlooked altogether.</p>

<div class="quote">

of themselves.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>If you must look for it, at any rate don’t look for it
in the last trick; you would scarcely look for the
Boat Race as you were going to church the next day.
Still, Cowper—though he clearly disapproves of the
signal and calls it senseless—seems, if he is to be
annoyed with it, to advocate this—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“’Tis well if look’d for at so late a day</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the last scene of such a senseless play.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">What the signal for trumps ought to be, and what
strength in trumps justifies a signal are clearly laid
down by Clay.</p>

<p>If you see a call and hold the ace and any number
of trumps, play the ace—there can be no danger of
dropping your partner’s king—and if you had originally
more than three, continue with the lowest; but
if you are quite sure that leading trumps is the only
way to miss or lose the game, don’t lead them at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Often as, in obedience to my partner’s call, I slam in
an ace and play my best trump, Elaine’s despairing
cry rises to my lips,—</p>

<div class="quote">
“Call and I follow, I follow, let me die.”
</div>

<p class="unindent">This important fact is too much lost sight of: that
the object of Whist is not so much to lead the lowest
but one of five, or to signal, as to win the game;
these and other fads may or may not be means to that
end, but the end itself they emphatically are not; in
their inception, at any rate, they were intended to be
your instruments. Don’t let this position be reversed;
whether, like fire, they are always good servants may
be open to argument, but their resemblance in the
other respect is perfect.</p>

<p>One aspect of signalling has been overlooked in all
the treatises on Whist. I have seen a player of great
common-sense and acute observation signal having
three small trumps and a short suit, and by this
means induce his watchful opponents to force him
to make them all. I do not recommend such devious
courses to you, even if they are lawful in a Christian
country (of which I have doubts); they are only practicable
when you are playing very good Whist, and
this, as Clay says, can only be the case when you
thoroughly know your men.</p>

<p>Hair-splitting about the legitimacy of the Peter is
beyond the scope of these remarks; what is lawful is
not necessarily expedient: this the Apostle Paul
pointed out, long before either the foundations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
New Orleans were laid, or Columbus discovered
America; but when Professor Pole—who appears to
have been acquainted with the present mode of signalling
for forty years (<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, April,
1879), and for nine has advised <i>learners</i> with five
trumps <i>always</i> to ask for them (<i>Theory of Whist</i>, page
65)—begins at this eleventh hour to find fault with the
practice, and to have his suspicions that it is immoral;
this is the Gracchi complaining of sedition with a
vengeance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A merciful Providence fashioned him holler,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A purpose that he might his principles swaller.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this year of grace, good players have long known
that signalling is by no means an unmixed benefit,
but rather an edge-tool dangerous to play with,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
while it has been so long rampant that it has permeated
the very lowest strata. If at such a time as
this—when all the tenth-rate Whist players in
Christendom and Jewry not only think they know
all about it, and consider it in itself the quintessence of
science, when many of them by constant practice
have actually acquired such skill that their hesitation
in playing first a ten and then a deuce is sometimes
scarcely perceptible—the professor imagines that any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
words of his can put a stop to it, his courage is only
equalled by that of the well-known Mrs. Partington
with her mop. A child may start an avalanche; but
once started it runs its appointed course, and in one
respect it is preferable—it is sooner over—for there is
no instance recorded in history of an avalanche keeping
on for forty years.</p>

<p>In bumblepuppy the proceedings are so complicated
and peculiar, they must be seen to be appreciated;
but there are five common forms you should
be acquainted with.</p>

<p>(1) After you have had a lead or two and got rid
of your winning cards, you can begin signalling for
somebody to lead a trump;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> if somebody obliges
you, and you win the trick, lead another suit, and
wait till somebody else leads trumps again—continuing
to signal in the intervals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>(2) You can signal in your own lead, and I don’t
know that there is any objection to your expecting
that your partner will attend to it—assuming he ever
comprehends what you are driving at.</p>

<p>(3) You can signal without any trump at all.</p>

<p>(4) You can signal without intending to do so.</p>

<p>(5) If by any odd chance there should be no signal
about, you can imagine there is and act accordingly.</p>

<p>To obviate the evident disadvantages and mutual
recrimination which might ensue from such vagaries,
if you really intend to signal, it is usual to take the
following precautions:</p>

<p>(1) Always signal with your highest card.</p>

<p>(2) Pause before you play it.</p>

<p>(3) Put it down not only with emphasis, but in a
special corner of the table mutually agreed upon
beforehand. (Note,<a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> <a href="#Page_59">page 59</a>.)</p>

<p>(4) As soon as the trick is turned, ask to see it.
(See <a href="#Footnote_59_59">note</a> to <a href="#Law_91">Law 91</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> are three kinds of false cards—</p>

<p>(1) Those that deceive everybody;</p>

<p>(2) Those that deceive your opponents only;</p>

<p>(3) Those that deceive your partner only; and a
sparing use of the two first—especially towards the
end of a hand—is often advantageous;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but in
playing cards that deceive everybody, you must be
prepared to take entire charge of the game yourself,
or you will probably have your conduct referred to
afterwards. The third is sacred to bumblepuppy.</p>

<p>One thing is very certain, that the original leader
is never justified in playing a false card.</p>

<p>Clay’s conclusion does not altogether harmonize
with his premises—a very unusual circumstance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
him—for after objecting strongly to false cards on
high moral grounds, and prefacing his remarks by
the expression of a touching belief that in no other
position of life would anybody tell him what is
untrue, he ultimately arrives at the delicious <i>non
sequitur</i>, that if your partner is very bad, or holds
miserably weak cards, or towards the end of a hand,
you may often play a false card with advantage:
why you should do what you know to be wrong,
because another person is bad, or weak, or because
you hold four cards and not thirteen, or even because
such nefarious conduct may benefit yourself, he does
not explain, and in default of that explanation he
appears stronger as a whist player than a moralist.
But the logic of whist is a thing <i>per se</i>, utterly
dissimilar to any known form of argument;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> it finds
vent in such syllogisms as “You ought to have
known I had all the spades, I led a diamond,” or,
“I must have the entire suit of clubs, I discarded
the deuce;” though the usual reply is “the deuce
you did,” this is merely paltering with a serious
subject; the only effective argument is to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
something at the speaker’s head—<i>the argumentum ad
hominem</i>—(of course this would create more or less
unpleasantness at first, but the speaker would soon
find his level, if you hit him hard enough) “unfortunately
this discipline by which such persons were
put to open penance and punished in this world—that
others admonished by their example might be
afraid to offend”—has fallen into desuetude; until
the said discipline be restored again, which—although
it is much to be wished<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>—can never be
until the present reprehensible practice of screwing
candle-sticks, match-boxes, and all reasonable missiles
into the table be done away with, you have two
courses open to you:</p>

<p>(1) You can give an evasive answer;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>(2) You can pretend to be deaf; this is a capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
plan, as it gives you the option either of being
unaware anybody spoke, or of totally misunderstanding
him.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> There is an utter inability to see that
any question can possibly have two sides, evidenced
by such remarks as “My finesse was justifiable, yours
was bad play.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The two prepositions, post and
propter, are constantly mistaken for one another—it
seems to be thought that because they both govern
the accusative case, their meaning is identical, or, to
speak more correctly, convertible.</p>

<p>But you must be prepared to contend against
other things besides false cards and curious logic;
there is a fiend often reported to be present in the
card-room, known by the name of “Luck,” and you
ought to be acquainted with two of the common
stratagems for circumventing him; it is by no means
unusual to see two obese elderly persons—who have
just lost a rubber by revoking, ruffing each other’s
winning cards with the thirteenth trumps, forgetting
to score honours <i>et id genus omne</i>—after first roundly
anathematizing this malefic spirit, taking precautions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
against such things happening again by slowly and
painfully rising from their respective chairs, and at
great personal inconvenience, changing places with
each other; this is one way; another is to throw
away several additional shillings in the purchase of
new cards; turning your chair round and sitting
down again is also supposed to have an emollient
tendency.</p>

<p>That there is such a thing—though stupidity is
often mistaken for it—is, to my mind, as undoubted
as that there are birds; but whether one or the other
is to be caught by putting salt on its tail—without
taking other precautions—must be left to that right
of private judgment already mentioned. (Page 34.)</p>

<p>It is true the Swan of Avon sings—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which we ascribe to Heaven,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">but he was only a literary person, not a whist player;
and if a careful exercise of your judgment satisfies
you that either calling (and paying) for new cards,
or wearing out the seats of your knickerbockers by
dodging from chair to chair, is a specific for want
of memory and attention, so let it be: whatever
conclusion you arrive at, it is your duty to respect
your seniors.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“None alive can truly tell</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What fortune they must see.”—<i>Sedley.</i></span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> “the Art of practical Whist” you will see capital
invested in Whist compared to consols; don’t run
away with the idea that there is any such resemblance;
those numerous foreign <i>securities</i> or limited companies
nearer home where you receive no interest and lose
your principal—or those public conveyances suggested
by the elder Mr. Weller—would be much
closer analogues.</p>

<p>Whist is not a certainty; neither is it true that you
will every year find your account exactly square on
the thirty-first of December—it is a popular fallacy
devised by those who win, to keep the losers in good
spirits.</p>

<div class="quote">
“Maxima vis est phantasiæ.”</div>

<p>An old friend of mine—veracious as men go, and
always considered of fairly sound mind and free
from delusions, though a very inferior whist-player—has
often assured me that he won over three
thousand points for three years running (close on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ten thousand in the aggregate); if this statement is
correct, and I have no reason to doubt it—I often
played with him, and he almost invariably won—it
is manifest that, after paying for the cards, some of
us when we called at the bank for our dividends,
must have had to go empty away.</p>

<p>I have played whist—club, domestic, or bumblepuppy—pretty
regularly for a quarter of a century,
and the only conclusion I have arrived at so far, is
the very vague one that I shall either win or lose—I
don’t know at all which—for five years in succession,
or multiples of five.</p>

<p>For the first ten years I won considerably, for the
next five I lost considerably, then for another five I
won slightly, and the last five (I am thankful to say
I am now getting well into the fifth) I have lost
again.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>I have no doubt things equalise themselves in the
long run, the difficulty is that I am unable to give
you any idea, even approximately, what the duration
of a long run is.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>During a part of that first period, extending over
a year and a quarter, I played long whist—five points
to the bumper—more than fifty times, and never but
once won less than twelve points. If we may believe
Herodotus, in his day the end was not always visible
from the beginning, and so it is now. I have won
rubbers against all the cards, and with all the cards I
have lost them.</p>

<p>Sometimes I cannot lose a rubber, sometimes I
cannot win one; at one time cards will beat their
makers, at another the makers will beat the cards,
and these results occur without rhyme or reason, in
defiance of any system of play. Don’t imagine for
a moment that I suggest play is of no consequence,
I merely say that you will frequently see the cards or
the players run wild, and that the actual result—winning
or losing—is beyond your own control.</p>

<div class="quote">
“In the reproof of chance lies the true proof of man.”—<i>Shakespeare.</i></div>

<p>I have known twenty-four successive rubbers lost,
and I have won seventeen more than once. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
lost nine hundred and thirty points in two months,
and a hundred and fifty-four in two days. I have
lost a bumper in two deals, holding one trump each
hand and with the same partner, the same seats, and
the same cards won the next rubber but one in two
deals, again holding one trump in each hand.</p>

<p>I have seen a player with no trump and no winning
card lose a treble, and the very next hand, again with
no trump and no winning card—assisted to some
extent by his partner—score nine, and on one melancholy
occasion my partner and myself were unable to
raise a trump between us; as a set-off to this, I ought
to admit that we once held them all.</p>

<p>Though I have never seen it myself, that the dealer
should give each member of the <i>parti</i> an entire suit
is becoming as common an object of the sea-shore
as our old friend the sea-serpent. Fortunately,
overpowering cards do not always win. A hand of
thirteen trumps has been known to make only one
trick; it occurred in this wise.</p>

<p>A, B, Y, and Z were playing in a train, and A dealt himself
the whole suit of hearts: Y led the king of spades;
B played the ace; Z followed suit, and A ruffed.</p>

<p>B, “an arbitrary gent,” ejaculated “Trump my
ace!” at once took up the trick and, with his own
twelve cards, threw the lot out of the window.</p>

<p>“The rest is silence.”</p>

<p>I have held three Yarboroughs in two hours (a
Yarborough is a hand containing no card above a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
nine), and a hand with no card above a seven at
least twice. There was a hand recently at Surbiton
with no card above a six. With ace, knave, to five
trumps, two kings, and trumps led up to me, I have
lost by five cards, and with queen, knave, 10, 8, 3, 2,
diamonds (trumps), spade king, ace and king of
hearts, ace, king, queen and another club, and the
original lead, I lost the odd trick; and, most incredible
of all, I know a very good player who, on three consecutive
Saturdays, lost an aggregate of over three
hundred points.</p>

<p>I have played a set match, and, although I never
bet, as I fancied we had a shade the best of the play,
and the other side made the liberal offer of six to
four, it tempted me, I took it and won five rubbers
running. I once cut about the best player I know
six times consecutively. My partner laid six to five
to commence with, and as we won the first game—a
single—he gave five to two, and that was the only
game we won in those six rubbers.</p>

<p>One of the two finest players I ever met lost
twenty-eight consecutive rubbers; feeling aggrieved
at this ill-treatment he swore off for a fortnight, and
then lost twelve more.</p>

<p>Busses—not Funds—is much nearer the mark. Irrespective
of the time of day, you can either go to bed
when you have won two rubbers, or when you have
lost them; you can persevere to the bitter end either
when you are winning or when you are losing; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
can take any of the measures mentioned in the last
lecture, or adopt any other system you please; but
there is one rule with no exception: though no
earthly power can prevent your winning or losing,
the actual amount of that gain or loss always depends
upon yourself and your partner; if you should ever
lose eighty or a hundred points at one sitting, that
deplorable result will never take place without your
active connivance; a trick lost here and a trick
lost there, an exposed card or something of that
kind—the consequence is always intensified when
you are losing—will just make the difference
every now and then between winning and losing a
rubber.</p>

<p>During the bad forty-eight hours I had when I
lost a hundred and fifty-four points, I was attending
carefully to the play, the cards were abominable,
and, making no allowances for what might have
happened if my partner and I had only been
omniscient, simple little mistakes of the kind just
mentioned accounted for thirty-two of those points.</p>

<p>If there is such a thing as luck—and I believe
there is—don’t lie down and let it kick you.</p>

<p>Always play with reasonable care and attention:—if
a thing is worth doing at all, it is worth doing
well—and when you hold cards which you do not
consider quite equal to your deserts, instead of playing
worse on that account—as most people do—take a
little extra care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>If your pocket money gives out, or you feel that
your cards are too bad for endurance, give up playing
altogether; but if you continue to play don’t exacerbate
your misfortunes by your own shortcomings; it
is bad enough to retire to your crib with empty
pockets, without a guilty conscience in addition.</p>

result of that observation—not the experience obtained

<p>(3) Ruff a suit of which your partner clearly holds
best, if you are weak in trumps.</p>

<p>(4) Never ruff anything if you are strong.</p>

<p>(5) Never return your partner’s trump if you can
possibly avoid it, unless he manifestly led it to bring
in a suit of which you led a singleton.</p>

<p>(6) Deceive him whenever you get a chance.</p>

<p>(7) Open a new suit every time you have the lead.</p>

<p>(8) Never pay any attention to your partner’s first
discard, unless it is a forced discard (page 32); lead
your own suit.</p>

<p>(9) Never force him under any circumstances unless
you hold at least five trumps with two honours;
even if you lose the rubber by it, play “the Game!”</p>

<p>(10) Devote all your remaining energies to looking
for a signal in the last trick. If you are unable to
discover which was your partner’s card—after keeping
the table waiting for two minutes—enquire what
trumps are, and lead him one on suspicion.</p>

your hesitation that you have no confidence in it
yourself?</p>

<p>If your partner renounces, and you think fit to
enquire whether he is void of the suit, do so quietly;
don’t offer a hint for his future guidance by glaring
or yelling at him.</p>

<p>Don’t ask idiotic questions; if you led an ace, and
the two, three, and four are played to the trick, what
is the use of asking your partner to draw his card?

recollect that though your Latin grammar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>

<p>According to the wisest man who ever lived,
“he that holdeth his peace is counted wise, and he

Such a reputation appears cheap at the
price; but—if you are of the opinion of J. P. Robinson
that “they didn’t know everything down in Judee”—you
can call your partner any names you like as
soon as the hand is over.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> You need not be at all

is ended, you discover that it might have been saved

<p>But never forget this! Before you proceed to give
your partner a piece of your mind, <i>always call your
honours!</i> for by neglecting this simple precaution, you
will often lay yourself open to a crushing rejoinder;

<p>Failing any other grievance, you can always prove
to demonstration—and at interminable length—that
if his cards, or your cards, or both your cards, had
been just the reverse of what they were, the result
would have been different; this certainly opens a
wide field for speculation, but it is neither an instructive
nor entertaining amusement, though it kills
time. “Oh, take one consideration with another, the
whist-player’s lot is not a happy one.”</p>

<p>There is a theory which, according to some evil-disposed
persons, may easily be made too much of—the
injury to yourself being remote and doubtful,
while the gratification of annoying him is certain
and immediate—that abusing your partner, as having
a tendency to make him play worse, is a mistake
from a pecuniary point of view; of course it is a
mistake, but not for such a paltry reason as that;
take a higher stand-point! Whether you are winning
or losing</p>

three prevailing hobbies are so cruelly over-ridden

Colam has never interfered: these are—</p>

<p>(1) The penultimate of a long suit.</p>

<p>(2) The signal for trumps.</p>

<p>(3) Not forcing your partner unless you are strong
in trumps—under any circumstances.</p>

<p>The first is, in the majority of cases, a nuisance;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
the second is stated to simplify the game and to
cause greater attention to be paid to it—practically
the entire time of the players is taken up, either in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
devising absurd signals or in looking for and failing
to see them: the third is responsible for losing about
as many games as anything I am acquainted with,
though the constant and aimless changing of suits
runs it close.</p>

<p>Is it any reason—because you have no trumps—that
you should announce that circumstance early in
the hand to the general public and prevent your
partner making one? If he has them all, you cannot
injure him; if he has not, the adversaries will play
through him and strangle him: why is it that you
are afraid to let your partner make a certain trick,
though you are never afraid to open a new suit?</p>

<p>An impression is abroad that there is somewhere a
law of whist to this effect: “Never force your partner
at any stage of the game unless you yourself are
strong in trumps.” Now there is no such thing.</p>

<p>Let us see what the authorities say on the point.
“Keep in mind that general maxims pre-suppose
the game and hand at their commencement, and
that material changes in them frequently require
that a different mode of play should be adopted.”
“It is a general maxim not to force your partner
unless strong in trumps yourself. There are,
however, many exceptions to this rule, as</p>

<p>(1) If your partner has led a single card.</p>

<p>(2) If it saves or wins a particular point.</p>

<p>(3) If great strength in trumps is declared against you.</p>

<p>(4) If you have a probability of a saw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>(5) If your partner has been forced and did not
lead trumps.</p>

<p>(6) It is often right in playing for an odd trick.</p>

<p>If your partner shows a weak game force him
whether or not you are otherwise entitled to do it.”—<i>Mathews.</i></p>

<p>With a weak trump hand force your partner:</p>

<p>“(1) When he has already shown a desire to be
forced, or weakness in trumps.</p>

<p>“(2) When you have a cross ruff.</p>

<p>“(3) When you are playing a close game as for
the odd trick, and often when one trick saves or
wins the game or a point.</p>

<p>“(4) When great strength in trumps has been
declared against you.”—<i>Cavendish.</i></p>

<p>“Do not force your partner unless to make sure
of the tricks required to save or win the game;</p>

<p>“Or, unless he has been already forced, and has not
led a trump;</p>

<p>“Or, unless he has asked to be forced by leading
from a single card, or two weak cards;</p>

<p>“Or, unless the adversary has led, or asked for
trumps.”—<i>Clay.</i></p>

<p>“Unless your partner has shown great strength in
trumps, or a wish to get them drawn, or has refused
to ruff a doubtful card, give him the option of making
a small trump, unless you have some good reason for
not doing so, other than a weak suit of trumps in
your own hand.”—<i>Art of Practical Whist.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>With these extracts before you, perhaps you will
dismiss from your mind the popular fallacy, that you
are under any compulsion to lose the game, because
your trumps are not quite so strong as you could wish.</p>

<p>Make a note of this.</p>

<p>Maxims were not invented for the purpose of preventing
you from either saving or winning the game,
though it is their unfortunate fate to be epitomized
and perverted out of all reasonable shape: the ill-advised
dictum, “Suppose the adversaries are four,
and you, with the lead, have a bad hand. The best
play is, in defiance of all system, to lead out your
best trump;” was comparatively innocuous till some
ingenious person, with a turn for abbreviation, altered
it into “Whenever you hold nothing, lead a trump!”
Use your common sense.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>I have gone into this matter at considerable length,
because I am convinced that however many people,
once affluent, are now in misery and want, owing to
their not having led trumps with five—Clay gave the
number as eleven thousand—a far larger number
have been reduced to this deplorable condition, by
changing suits and refusing <i>on principle</i> to save the
game by forcing their partner.</p>

<p>Before quitting the subject, there is another branch
of it worthy of a little consideration: when your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
partner by his discard has shown which is his suit,
and you hold two or three small cards in it, however
strong you may be in trumps—<i>unless everything
depends on one trick</i>—do you expect to gain much
by forcing him and making yourself third player?
though it is usual to play in this absurd way, is there
any objection to first playing his suit and—as, <i>ex
hypothesi</i>, you are strong in trumps—forcing him
afterwards?</p>

<p>Play always as simply and intelligibly as you can!</p>

<p>In addition to your partner not being able to see
your cards—in itself a disadvantage—he is by an
immutable law of nature, much inferior in perception
to yourself; you should bear this in mind and not be
too hard on the poor fellow.</p>

<p>Never think!<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Know! Leave thinking to the Teuton:</p>

<p>After the game has begun, the time for thinking
has passed: as soon as a card is led it is the time
for action, the time to bring to bear your previously
acquired knowledge.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>If you are blest with a sufficiently sharp eye to
the left, you may occasionally <i>know</i> that a card is
false, but knowledge acquired in that way I should
not describe as thinking; I should use a quite
different expression.</p>

own eye is the bane of whist.</p>

<p>Why imitate Mark Twain’s fiery steed? Why, when
it is your business to go on, “lean your head against
something, and think?”</p>

<p>Whether you have seen a thing or not seen it,
there can be no necessity for thought; recondite
questions—such as whether the seven is the best of
a suit of which all the others but the six are out, or
whether a card is the twelfth or thirteenth—can be
answered by a rational being in one of two ways, and
two only; either he knows, or he does not know, there
is no <i>tertium quid</i>; the curious practice of gazing
intently at the chandelier and looking as intelligent
as nature will permit—if not more so—though it

miscalled, <i>thinking</i>. It is not a new invention, for
it has been known and practised from the earliest
times. “There is a generation, O how lofty are their
eyes; and their eyelids are lifted up.”—<i>Proverbs,
chap.</i> 30, <i>verse</i> 13, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 1,000. Pecksniff, who had an

<p class="unindent">But, however ancient and venerable the practice may
be, it is one of those numerous practices more
honoured in the breach than in the observance;
surely, looking on the table is more in accordance
with the dictates of common sense than attempting
to eliminate unknown quantities from a chandelier.
In the one you have gas and probably water; on the
other—lying open before you—the data required. I
have now endeavoured, not to teach you either whist
or bumblepuppy, but to point out a few of the differences
between them, and to start you on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
road. The first is a game of reason and common
sense, played in combination with your partner; the
second is a game of inspiration, haphazard, and
absurdity, where your partner is your deadliest
enemy. I have made a few extracts from Mathews—partly
because I do not like novelties merely
because they are novelties—partly to convince the
bumblepuppist (if anything will convince him) that
when he tells me the recognised plan is a new
invention, introduced by Cavendish for his especial
annoyance, he does not know what he is talking
about; and partly to show you that since that book
was written—eighty years ago—the main principles
of Whist are almost unaltered.</p>

<p>The chapter on etiquette is since his time; but,
although the game has been cut down one-half,
take away from Mathews his slight partiality for
sneakers—to be accounted for by the possibility of
his partner at that remote period being even a
more dangerous lunatic than yours is at present,
and the consequent necessity for playing more on
the defensive (for leading singletons, whatever else
it may do, and however it may damage the firm,
does not injure the leader)<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> take away from the play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of to-day its signal, its echo, and its penultimate of
a long suit; (all excrescences of doubtful advantage
for general purposes, and the last two more adapted
to that antediluvian epoch when human life was
longer)—and the continuity of the game is clear.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Whether Whist would gain anything by their
omission I am unable to say; the attention, now
always on the strain in <i>looking</i> for its accidents,
would have a spare moment or two to devote to its
essentials; whether it would do anything of the kind
is another matter.</p>

<p>Those followers of Darwin and believers in the
doctrine of evolution, to whom it is a source of
comfort that an ascidian monad and not Eve was
their first parent, must find the Whist table rather
a stumbling block: they will there see uncommonly
few specimens of the survival of the fittest. A cynic
with whom I was once conversing on this subject,
remarked that they were much more likely to come
across the missing link.</p>

<p>The philosopher of Chelsea long since arrived at
the unsatisfactory and sweeping conclusion, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
population of these islands are mostly fools, and he
has made no exception of the votaries of Whist.
Still, it has the reputation of being a very pretty
game, though this reputation must be based to a
great extent on conjecture; for apart from its other
little peculiarities—on some of which I have briefly
touched—its features are so fearfully disfigured by
bumblepuppy, that it is as difficult to give a positive
opinion as to say whether a woman suffering from
malignant small-pox might or might not be good
looking under happier circumstances. The sublime
self-confidence expressed in the distich—</p>

<p class="unindent">has not been vouchsafed to me, but if ever I obtain
a clear view of it, I will undertake to report upon it
to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>You may have heard that if you are ignorant of
Whist you are preparing for yourself a miserable
old age: it is by no means certain that a knowledge
of it—as practised at this particular period—is to be
classed with the beatitudes.</p>

<div class="quote">
“O tempora! O mores!”</div>
<div class="blockquot">
“To seek to extinguish anger utterly is but a bravery of
the Stoics.”—<i>Bacon.</i></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I am</span> afraid that you will hear at the whist table a
good deal about temper, unless you are particularly
fortunate; that so-and-so is good-tempered, or
the reverse; that if we were all better tempered,
something or other might be different, and similar
platitudes. Now these mostly start on the utterly
false assumption that everybody is equally subject to
the same annoyances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tender and delicate persons must needs be oft angry;
they have so many things to trouble them, which more robust
natures have little sense of.”—<i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>That the greatest exponent of Bumblepuppy has
necessarily the longest temper goes without saying—of
course he has! He has nothing to ruffle him, for
he has everything his own way; he plays as he thinks
fit (supposing him to think at all, or ever to be fit);
if his partner makes a mistake it is any odds he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
never sees it; <i>de non existentibus et non apparentibus
eadem est ratio</i>; here is one cause of equanimity.</p>

<p>If it is any amusement to him—and I presume it is,
otherwise he would not do it—from his cradle to his
grave to play a game of which he knows absolutely
nothing, and if in pursuit of that amusement he
thinks it worth his while to take a certain amount of
his own and his partner’s capital, and to throw it in
the street, why should he lose his temper? Although
he has paid his money, he has had his choice—another
cause of equanimity.</p>

<p>Ah Sin played a game he did not understand, and
remained quite calm and unperturbed, though he was
a heathen and an Asiatic; while his antagonist disgraced
our common Christianity by letting his angry
passions rise because things were going against him.</p>

<p>If both partners, then, are of the same mind and
the same calibre—either bad or good—to quote an
American author, “all is peas,” and like the place</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Quarrels should never come.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The difficulty begins to arise when one of the partners
fails to see things altogether in the same light as
the other. He may be so unfortunately constituted
(cross-grained the other would say) that he is unable
to derive any amusement from the game unless it is
played with a modicum of intelligence; it is just
possible that instead of considering gold as dross, as
an accursed thing to be got rid of at the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
opportunity, he may be actuated by a depraved love
of filthy lucre, and a sordid desire for gain; such
conditions are to be deplored, but they exist and
must be reckoned with.</p>

<p>When his partner proceeds to run amuck, he
misses the point of the joke; his perverted moral
sense revolts against paying half the money, and the
other man having all the choice; probably, for a
time, he keeps his mouth tightly shut, but his
<i>collaborateur</i> is not to be eluded in that way; he
demands not merely the passive, but the active assent
of his victim, and sooner or later, after the perpetration
of some particularly atrocious <i>coup</i>, inquires
with the bland and childlike smile of the heathen
already referred to, “Partner, I think we could not
have done better there?” What is to be done
now? Silence is not an answer; it used to be, but
has been disestablished. Are you to agree with
him? Are you to state what is false? Are you to
dissent and be informed you are always finding fault?
(Shakespeare’s retort is neat and worthy of him:
“You have always been called a merciful man,
partner;” but we are not all Shakespeares.) Or
is it the best course at once to resort to active
measures, and throw at him the first thing that
comes to hand?</p>

<p>The worm must turn some time or other; it may
turn the other cheek, but that is only temporising;
no worm has more than two cheeks, and when it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
had them both slapped, what is it to do then? We
come to an <i>impasse</i>.</p>

<p>The copy-books used to tell us—for anything I
know they may do so yet—copy-book aphorisms have
a marvellous vitality, and you have seen them since I
have—that “patience is a virtue” (I think virtue
ought to have a capital V), and, as an abstract
proposition, the statement is probably as true and
more grammatical than “There’s milestones on the
Dover Road”; but what is the use of it? The question
is, will it wash? The two best known examples
of this virtue are the Patriarch Job and the patient
ass. Whether the Patriarch was well advised in
enduring his friends so long, and whether he endured
them on account of his patience, or whether the
bodily affliction from which he was notoriously
suffering at the time, incapacitated him from taking
energetic steps to expel them from his bed-room, are
questions difficult to decide so long after the event.
I express no opinion of my own; let the dead past
bury its dead: <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>; but
the donkey is a different matter; he lives in our
own times, and I know him well; he touches me
nearly; and I unhesitatingly affirm that the only
benefit—if benefit is the proper term—he has ever
derived from his long-suffering, has been to be
invariably imposed upon in consequence. Casa
Bianca on the burning deck is another case in point;
he did score to a certain extent, for owing to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
patience his widowed mother escaped an undertaker’s
bill, while he himself is known to this day in the
nursery as “the noble boy”; but to the more mature
observer, in whom the ambition to be called names is
dead, the game is hardly worth the candle; while
you yourselves will be called quite enough names at
the whist table without being cremated; not to mention
that the majority of you probably prefer pudding
to praise.</p>

<p>Some irritable people go so far as to apply language
of a condemnatory character to the inanimate cards;
as it is impossible to arouse any emotion either of
pleasure or anger in their breasts, this seems absurd
and a waste of energy. It must be bad form to
excite yourself without causing annoyance to others,
and should certainly be avoided.</p>

<p>Believing luck to be strictly personal, it appears to
me that calling for new cards is an unnecessary display
of temper and throwing good money after bad.</p>

<p>We may take it, speaking generally—for it is not
always the case—that the worse a man plays, the less
visible is his bad temper; the converse fortunately
does not hold good, for many good players have
really wonderful tempers.</p>

<p>One curious circumstance is that want of perception
and thickness of mental cuticle are usually
looked upon by the unfortunate possessors as proofs
of good temper, and boasted of as such. This is not
the case in other afflictions. I once knew a man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a Barbadoes leg, and though its circumference much
exceeded that of mine, he never made any offensive
comparisons.</p>

<p>In Bath I have seen scores of invalids—mostly
naval and military men, naturally warlike—they were
all seated decorously in the local chairs; and when
they dismounted and hobbled into the club, they did
not go about brandishing their crutches and bragging
that they had refrained from assaulting us innocent
civilians; on the contrary, I always found them most
courteous and friendly.</p>

<p>To sum up the matter; we are all worms of some
kind, and we all turn more or less when we are
trodden upon, if we perceive it. The denser the
worm, the more slowly he turns. While some ill-conditioned
ones turn under all circumstances, some
of the most highly-organised are scarcely ever known
even to wriggle. Apparently harmless ones sometimes
turn most suddenly and ferociously. Those
most trodden upon—unless quite <i>hors de combat</i>—turn
most.</p>

<p>Finally, many congenitally mal-formed worms, and
worms suffering from amaurosis, cerebral ramollissement,
myxædema, and other dreadful diseases, are
not only unaware of their critical state, but are
actually proud of it, and look upon it as a proof of
their amiable disposition.</p>

<h2>LECTURE XIII.<br />

——<br />

<small>DETERIORATION OF WHIST, ITS CAUSES AND CURE.</small><br />

——</h2>

<div class="quote">
“Past and to come seem best; things present worst.”—<i>Shakespeare.</i>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> my time I believe Whist has on the whole
deteriorated,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> it mistakes means for ends, is
more tricky, more difficult, more cantankerous;
with regard to common mistakes—inability to hold
a few cards without dropping them on the table,
or to play them one at a time; inability to count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
thirteen, to recollect the best card, or whether it
was your opponents, your partner, or yourself who
first led a suit; winning your partner’s trick, or
not winning your adversary’s; leading out of turn,
revoking, and so on—there is not much difference.</p>

<p>As long as I can recollect, Whist has been gorged
with these, and neither the hydraulic ram nor any
other of the improved mechanical appliances of the
present day can squeeze into a thing more than it
will hold. Architects of card-rooms are to blame
for a good deal of this bad Whist; it is impossible to
play in a badly lighted, or a badly ventilated room.
Whist players have often told me exactly what they
require, and it is very odd they cannot have it.</p>

<p>With a large fire, the room hermetically sealed,
and everybody smoking, the temperature should
never exceed sixty-one-and-a-half degrees, nor be
below sixty. There must be neither doors (they
admit draughts) nor windows: windows are open—allow
me to withdraw that offensive word—windows
are exposed to two objections, (1) some scoundrel,
regardless of consequences, might lower or raise
the sash; (2) instead of being placed in the ceiling
or the floor—where you would naturally expect to
find them—they are always at the side of the room,
and no whist player can see a card with the
windows in such a position.</p>

<p>Candles do not give sufficient light, and gas is
unbearable; a suggestion to try an attic with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
skylight fell through (not through the skylight—I
mean the suggestion failed), because no one was
able to go upstairs; a lift would overcome that
objection, but the temperature difficulty remained.</p>

<p>This only applies to clubs; curiously enough, in
small stuffy back-rooms in private houses, gas never
causes head-ache, and neither a mephitic atmosphere
nor a temperature of 120° is at all disagreeable.</p>

<p>Joking apart, the <i>fons et origo mali</i> is <a href="#Law_91">Law 91</a>, and
not only the head and front of the offending, but
its barrel and hind quarters as well.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Since the introduction of signalling, the subsequent
petrolatry, and all the elaborate functions
of that cultus, an exaggerated importance (increasing
in geometric ratio with every additional convention)
has been attached to the last trick—the only place
where, by universal consent, anything can reasonably
be “looked for”—and if you, after seeing the cards
played, informing your partner which is yours (of
course, in answer to his enquiry), gathering the
trick and arranging it neatly, should imagine you
have done with it, you will be the victim of a fond
delusion—using “fond” in the old acceptation of
the word. First, your partner will ask to see it at
least twice, then your opponents, one or both, will
probably grab at it without asking, and put it back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in a dishevelled condition; it is useless to specify
what their mental state must be, and unfortunately,
by the time all these irritating performances have
been gone through and you have again arranged the
trick symmetrically, you will find yours is not all you
could wish. You can avoid some of these annoyances
by allowing your partner to gather the tricks,
but from his slovenly mode of doing so, you will
never be able to see how many he has; and just as
you are endeavouring to concentrate your attention
at a critical point, it will be distracted by your having
to make an intricate calculation how the game stands,
the data being the cards remaining in your hand, and
two confused heaps on the table; as long as this is
permitted, whist is out of the question, and you feel
inclined to say with the Divine Williams,</p>

<div class="quote">
“Let him have a table by himself.”</div>

<p class="unindent">One of the principal uses of the new method of
suspended animation will turn out to be, that all
decent whist players will have to submit themselves
to it, and remain, arranged in rows on shelves, until
that law is abrogated.</p>

<p>The number of shelves required will not appreciably
affect the timber trade.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>In the good time coming, promised by the poet to
those of you who wait a little longer, when the
present inspired, convention-ridden, and last-trick-inspecting
generation is in the silent tomb or
cremated, as the case may be, and a new school—basing
its play on common sense and attention—has
arisen, there may be an improvement; but as I
am not an optimist I cannot join in the aspiration of
the little girl whose world was hollow and whose
doll was stuffed with sawdust; therefore, though this
improvement, like the millennium, may be looming
in the more or less remote future, I see no sign of
it at present.</p>

<p>If “to everything there is a season and a time to
every purpose under the sun,” also “<i>a time to lose
and a time to cast away</i>.”—Ecclesiastes, chap. 1,
verse 1-6: it seems clear to me there must be a
time for bumblepuppy.</p>

<p>Some people deny this, they say that the argument
proves too much; they point out that Shakespeare
says there are</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sermons in stones, and good in everything.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and that as this could not apply to bumblepuppy,
these passages only show that it was unknown
when they were written.</p>

<p>Another argument of theirs against the antiquity
of bumblepuppy, based on the passage “in all
labour there is profit,” is altogether fallacious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
unworthy of consideration; they admit the labour
but deny the profit. This must have had its origin
east of Temple Bar, where it is held there is no
profit unless it assumes a pecuniary form. But the
repressing your innate tendency to profane swearing,
curbing your evil passions generally, and the
cultivation—under considerable difficulties—of nearly
all the cardinal virtues, as inuring to your moral
well-being, are a profit of the most positive kind;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
to be able to give a definite answer to the long-standing
conundrum “is life worth living?” is something.</p>

<p>However, you can draw your own conclusion, the
extract from Shakespeare is—I confess—difficult to
get over, still, when Solomon makes use of these
remarkable words “a time to lose and a time to
cast away,” I fail to see what he could have had in
his mind, unless it was this very game.</p>

<p>At any rate one thing is clear, bumblepuppy
exists now, and is not a pretty game (there can
be no two opinions about that); neither—judging
from the demeanour and language of its exponents—is
it a pleasant game. I append a hand, which
is, I think, the finest specimen of it I ever saw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Judge for yourself. I had jotted down a few further
remarks on this repulsive subject, but on reading
them over, they seem to be not only inconsistent
with that extreme reverence which is due to the
young, but absolutely unfit for publication.</p>

<p>This is the worst hand ever played, without exception;
it is a microcosm, complete in itself, and
contains examples of stupidity, selfishness, duplicity,
defiance of all recognized principles, and every conceivable
villainy.</p>

<p>Trick 2.—The misplaced ingenuity in deceiving Y
as to the position of the Qn is worth notice.</p>

<p>Trick 3.—The lead of the only weak suit, in
preference to the strong suit of clubs, playing up
to declared weakness in hearts, or returning the
trump is very neat.</p>

<p>Trick 5.—The force here of the trump leader,
inducing him to believe that Z at any rate holds the
remaining spades, an illusion carefully fostered by
B, is especially good.</p>

<p>Trick 7.—The return of the trump at this point
with the best trump (probably) and three long
spades (certainly) declared against him in one hand,
is a real gem.</p>

<h3>THE DOMESTIC RUBBER.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
fool nowhere but in his own house.”—<i>Shakespeare.</i></p></div>

<p>A third variety of whist, the domestic rubber, I
have passed over in silence; what takes place in the
sanctity of private life it would be as unbecoming
for me to divulge as for you to seek to know;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O’er all its faults we draw a tender veil,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So great its sorrows and so sad its tale.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">At the same time I don’t think I am violating any
confidence in stating that you will find there neither
signalling, nor the penultimate of five and its
developments: yet, though free from these annoyances,
the game, even when mitigated by muffins,
music, and the humanizing influence of woman is
inexpressibly dreary, and you had better keep out
of it if you can; but should this not be practicable,—for
some relative from whom you have a reasonable
expectation of a tip may be staying in the house,
and you may be compelled to sacrifice yourself either
on the altar of duty or of self-interest—then never
forget that sweetness of temper is much more
important here than knowledge of Whist, and
consoling yourself with the following two reflections:</p>

<p>(1) That (according to Epicurus) prolonged pain is
pleasant rather than otherwise, extreme pain always
short;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>(2) That those whom the gods love die young;
when your hour arrives, bare your throat to the knife
with a smile.</p>

<p>So shall your memory smell sweet and blossom in
domestic circles.</p>
<div class="center">———</div>

<h3>DOUBLE DUMMY.</h3>

<p>Double dummy is not Whist, nor anything like it,
it much more closely resembles chess; one is a game
of inference, the other is an exact science, where the
position of every card is known.</p>

<p>Often, in the course of a controversy on Whist, you
will hear one of the disputants challenging the other
to play double dummy, imagining that he has clenched
the matter; it would be quite as germane to suggest
trial by battle, or to move an adjournment to a good
dry skittle alley.</p>

<p>“The bearings of these observations lays in the
application of them. That an’t no part of my duty.
Avast then, keep a bright look out for’ard, and good
luck to you.”</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE I.<br />

——</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">As</span> my present aim is confined to purveying food for
babes in an elementary and easily assimilable
form, and to calling your attention to <a href="#Law_91">Law 91</a>, any
lengthened disquisition on the more recent conventions
would be out of place.</p>

<p>More competent critics than myself flatly deny that
they are food for anybody, and have denounced them,
lock, stock, and barrel, in <i>The Field</i>, <i>Longman’s</i>, <i>Cornhill</i>,
<i>Knowledge</i>, <i>Whist</i>, and numerous daily and
weekly papers.</p>

<p>Having given my opinion elsewhere, I would
merely remark that though, in your allotted span of
three-score years and ten—after deducting a reasonable
time for rest and refreshment, say eight hours a
day—you may possibly master such an intricate
absurdity as the plain suit echo, that result is highly
improbable, and most assuredly not worth the
trouble.</p>

<p>Still, though the thanes have revolted, they are
not immortal, and must shortly join the great men
who have gone before; the future is in your hands,
and if you wish Whist to endure you must bestir
yourselves at once; there is no time to lose. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
times have been, that when the brains were out, the
man would die;” those times may return at any
moment and where will the modern game be then?</p>

<p>Already its authors have provided you with the
following dogmata:—</p>

<ul class="booklist">
<li><i>the lead of uniformity;</i></li>
<li><i>the discard of uniformity;</i></li>
<li><i>the suit of uniformity;</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="unindent">all three of them rooted in error—a melancholy
tripod to hang the fine old game upon, with a
strong family likeness to the Manx emblem, three
legs all abroad and no head-piece—if you give these
iconoclasts a little more rope, they have only to
formulate <i>the hand of uniformity</i>, and the <i>corpus</i> or
rather the <i>cadaver</i> of Whist will be complete.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE II.<br />

——</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> readers of these lectures have complained
that it is often difficult to discriminate when
they are serious and when they “attempt to be
funny,” and have suggested that the attempts
should be indicated clearly by a note, thus
<img src="images/i-129-index.jpg" width="31" height="19" alt="hand" />
“this is a goak”!—and the remainder printed in red
ink. While fully recognizing their difficulty and
sympathizing with them, I am unable to entertain
either proposal; the first is an American innovation
utterly at variance with the conservative
character of the work; and it is a fatal objection to
the other that if whatever is important were picked
out in red, many well-disposed children would at
once rush to the natural—but highly erroneous—conclusion,
that they had got hold of a Prayer Book.
Another complaint, that my advice to Bumblepuppists
is likely to lead them further astray is beside the
question, even assuming—for the sake of this
argument—such a thing to be possible; the point
is whether I have described “the game” correctly,
and I am prepared to stake my reputation as an
experienced Bumblepuppy player, that I have done
so without manifesting fear, favour, or affection.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13">[13]</a> It was introduced as “a proposed extension of principle,”
but you had better stick to the old adage, “first catch your
principle,” and leave the extension of it to some future time.
Theoretical advantages of this lead, and also the echo of the
signal, you will find fully set forth in “Cavendish.” In a letter
to the <i>Field</i>, September 27th, 1879, he appears to advocate varying
its monotony by occasionally leading the lowest but <i>two</i>.
Cam, the original patentee of this invention, and one of the
finest players of his day, directs you to lead the lowest but
one only when you hold no honour in the suit. By this plan
you can not only count your partner’s hand—the apparent end
of most modern Whist—but after you have made the queen
and lost your king on the return, you have the additional
gratification of knowing to a certainty that he does not even
hold the knave.</p>

<p>With regard to the echo, I have no head for intricate
mathematical calculations, and therefore am unable to tell
you at about what trick everything would be ready, but speaking
roughly, I should be afraid that for all practical purposes the
hand would occasionally be over before the signaller and the
echoer had completed their operations. In the “Art of
Practical Whist” you are recommended to lead the lowest but
two of six. (The advice of <i>Punch</i> to those about to marry is
applicable here.)</p>

<p>Mr. F. H. Lewis, in the <i>Field</i>, January, 1880, has propounded
a scheme for sub-dividing the echo into categories, and it has
recently been pointed out to me that by leading trumps in
some irregular way—understood, I presume, by the inventor
of the process—you can explain to your partner that you
originally held four. “Is there anything whereof it may be
said, see, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which
was before us.” When all these improvements are in use, this
is clear, the elect will return to that fine old practice known as
“piping at whisk”; the rest of us to primæval chaos.</p></div>

cases by rule of thumb (<i>Field</i>, October 1882), and obtained the
same result; if in the teeth of this, <i>early in the hand</i>, a decent
Whist-player plays the king second on a small card led, it is
an unnecessarily high card; and as unnecessarily high cards
are not played without an object, that object is presumably a
call for trumps.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18">[18]</a> “With ace, queen, etc., of a suit of which your right
hand adversary leads the knave, put on the ace invariably.
No good player, with king, knave, ten, will begin with the
knave: of course, it is finessing against yourself to put on the
queen, and, as the king is certainly behind you, you give away
at least the lead, without any possible advantage.”—<i>Mathews.</i>
This advice as a rule is sound, but you must bear in mind that
towards the end of a hand the knave is often led from king,
knave, ten, or king, knave alone, and if you, holding ace,
queen, are obliged to make two tricks in the suit, in order to
win, or save the game, you will have to play the queen. If
the king is held by your left-hand adversary, you will lose the
game whatever you play. When you play the queen under
these circumstances, and it comes off, don’t imagine that you
are inspired, or præternaturally intelligent; you are only playing
to the score; and you will find that most instances of
irregular play, which at first sight suggest inspiration, resolve
themselves into this.</p></div>

1879, “Conventions are certain modes of play established by
preconcerted arrangement;” by whom established, preconcerted,
or arranged is not mentioned; and I am very much
afraid that this definition leaves a loop-hole for winking at
your partner when you want trumps led—of course “by
preconcerted arrangement”—otherwise it would be unfair and
(as he might mistake it for a nervous affection of the eyelid)
absurd. At Whist you can call anybody or anything whatever
you please; I have been told, but I scarcely believe it, that

<p>With the score three all, I have seen the original leader,
holding ace, knave, nine, to five trumps, and the ten turned
up—play a singleton, knock his partner’s king on the head,
and then begin to signal, while the adversaries were making
the next two tricks in that very suit: his partner ruffed the
fourth, and with king and queen of the two unopened suits,
led the queen of trumps, killed the king in the second hand,
and the signaller then proceeded to wait about, and with all
the remaining trumps on his right, eventually lost three by
cards.</p>
<p>I have seen another <i>player</i> of many years’ standing first
lead a plain suit and then call; his partner echoed it, and
they lost four by cards, and I <i>have been told</i> that some time
after a table had broken up, and three of the party had left

may be the acme of skill.</p></div>

reply it is quite possible I do not play so well as I did five
years ago, I make the sneerer a present of the admission, but
I play better than I did twenty years ago, when—playing
against as good players as I do now—if I did not win every

very little use in determining such propositions. It can be
demonstrated to the satisfaction of everyone that the odds,
after having won the first game in a rubber, in favour of
winning one of the next two games is three to one. Yet
Mr. Clay considered that five to two was a bad bet, and we
have lost not only at five to two but at two to one, and on
one occasion we actually lost the long odds in two hundred
bets, a hundred and three times, so that if we were to take
this result as of any value, the odds would be slightly in
favour of losing a rubber when you had won the first game,
which is absurd.”—<i>Westminster Papers.</i></p></div>

more rare than a black swan (these can be bought any day at
Jamrach’s by the couple, but even in the present hard times

he has not one fine whist-player in stock); essential to

<p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49">[49]</a> Though whist is reported to be an old English word
meaning silence, and though it is advisable for many reasons
that it should be played with reasonable quiet, it is not at all
compulsory to conduct yourself as if in the monastery of La
Trappe; you have a perfect right—as far as the laws of whist
are concerned—to discuss at any time the price of stocks, the
latest scandal, or even the play going on, “provided that no
intimation whatever, by word or gesture, be given as to the
state of your own hand or the game.”—<i>Etiquette of Whist.</i></p>
<p>At bumblepuppy you had better waive this right altogether,
for if under any circumstances you open your mouth,
you will infallibly put your foot into it. Even here, the
bumblepuppist is not consistent, for while constantly laying
down the extraordinary law—in a very loud voice—that whist
is silence, he considers the carrying out of that law much
more incumbent on the rest of the table than himself.</p></div>

<p>“The education of the whist-player is peculiar. How he
becomes a whist-player nobody knows. He never learns his
alphabet or the catechism or anything that he ought to do.
He appears full-grown, mushroom-like. He remembers
someone blowing him up for doing something he ought not
to have done, and somebody else blowing him up for doing
something else, and he is blown up to the end of the chapter.
This phase of being blown up is varied by grumbling sometimes
aloud, sometimes <i>sotto voce</i>; so that the whist-player is
reared on scolding and grumbling as other youngsters are
reared on pap. Truly this is a happy life. Some men grumble
on principle because it is a national privilege, and they avail
themselves of the Englishman’s birthright.”</p>

<p>This is the first new game for two players, played with ordinary
cards, since the introduction of Bezique about thirty years ago. It is
easily learned, is full of interest, and has several quite new features—notably
the mode of originating or preventing Trump, and the <i>Bar</i>.
This Volume contains all that is needed for self-instruction, including a
complete game played and explained, and illustrated by card diagrams.</p>

<p>This most simple and effective apparatus does away with the need for any
sorting of the hands afterwards. It permits a record of the play if required
for analysis, and provides the means of testing different methods of strategy.
The hands played by A-B and Y-Z during a series of twelve games are afterwards
transposed for the after-play, so that each side should be able to win
an equal number of tricks. For the after-playing, the games may or may
not be taken in consecutive order; each side has the same number of deals
and original leads, and therefore any advantage in the score must be the
result of superior play.</p>

<p>Brilliant games constantly escape the attention they deserve, owing to the
inconvenience of spending time in sorting the cards to their original
position. By the use of this Invention such games are preserved, and can
be played again either at once or subsequently. The entire apparatus is
easily portable, measuring (with the cards) only 9½ × 4 × 2¾-inches.</p>

—————<br />


<small>BY THE AUTHOR OF</small><br />
<big>“FOSTER’S WHIST MANUAL.”</big><br />


—————</div>

<p>It is generally admitted that the most popular and useful book on Whist ever
written is “Foster’s Whist Manual.” Another work, by the same author, entitled
“Whist Tactics” is intended to carry players a step farther, and should enable
them to become past-masters of whist strategy.</p>

<p>The methods which ensured the success of the “Manual” are followed in the
present work, the author first giving the examples to be practised with the actual
cards, and then explaining the principles underlying their proper management.
In the “Manual” only the simple elements of the game are treated of, such as the
leads 2nd and 3rd hand play, etc.; but in “Whist Tactics” the general management
of the entire hand is examined; the relations of the plain suits to each other and to
the trumps are shown; and certain simple, clear, and well-defined rules are given,
which will enable any player immediately to judge which course it is best to pursue
when he finds the plain suits and the trumps in certain proportions to each other.</p>

<p>It is also shown that after one or more tricks have been played the hand must
no longer be treated on its own merits, but must be considered in its relation to the
known or inferred peculiarities of those of the three other players.</p>

<p>The examples which the author uses throughout the work consist of 112 hands
at Duplicate Whist, which were played by correspondence between sixteen of the
finest players in America. For every card played in this match, each of the players
had a week in which to think over the situation; and the result has provided 112 examples
of the very best and most carefully studied whist ever played.</p>

<p>The author continually refers to these illustrative hands in order to show that
certain general principles of tactics are followed by all the best players, and that it
is neither more nor less than the proper understanding and use of these tactics
which make their play so much better than that of the others.</p>

<p>The arrangement and presentation of the subject are quite original, and entirely
different from that pursued in any other work on whist; and the publishers are
confident that it will be welcomed as the most comprehensive work ever written on
the game.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
